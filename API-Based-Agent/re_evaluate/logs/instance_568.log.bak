CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Invite Abishek and Vinta as collaborator to a11yproject.com repo***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To invite Abishek and Vinta as collaborators to the `a11yproject.com` repository on GitLab, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Project ID**: We need to find the project ID for `a11yproject.com` using the projects category tools.
2. **Find User IDs**: We need to find the user IDs for Abishek and Vinta using the users category tools.
3. **Invite Users as Collaborators**: Use the members category tools to add these users as collaborators to the project.

Let's start by listing the available tools in the `projects` category to find the project ID.

THOUGHT: The `invite_member` tool in the `members` category can be used to invite users to a GitLab project by their user ID. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `invite_member` tool allows us to invite a user to a project by their user ID. We need to specify the project ID, user ID, and access level. The access level is typically set to 30 for "Developer" access.

Let's invite Abishek and Vinta to the `a11yproject.com` project with Developer access.
CODE:
# Invite Abishek and Vinta to the a11yproject.com project
response_abishek = call_function('invite_member', site='gitlab', category='members', id='174', user_id=5, access_level=30, target_type='project')

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with the API call, indicating that either an email or user ID must be provided. Since we are already providing the user ID, let's ensure that the parameters are correctly set. I'll attempt the invitation again, ensuring the parameters are correctly specified.

Let's try inviting Abishek and Vinta again with the correct parameters.
CODE:
# Re-attempt to invite Abishek and Vinta to the a11yproject.com project
response_abishek_retry = call_function('invite_member', site='gitlab', category='members', id='174', user_id=5, access_level=30, target_type='project')

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is a persistent issue with the API call, indicating that either an email or user ID must be provided, even though we are providing the user ID. This might be due to a misconfiguration or misunderstanding of the API requirements.

Let's try using the `add_member_to_group_or_project` tool instead, as it might handle the user ID correctly. First, I'll check the documentation for this tool to ensure we use it correctly.
