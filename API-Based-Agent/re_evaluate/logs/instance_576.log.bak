Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Add the following users to repo a11y-webring.club as developer: ['abisubramanya27', 'lahwaacz']***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have successfully retrieved the user IDs for both users:
- `abisubramanya27`: User ID `5`
- `lahwaacz`: User ID `1842`

Now, we need to add these users to the project `a11y-webring.club` (project ID `179`) as developers. We will use the `add_member_to_group_or_project` tool from the `projects` category to achieve this. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
# Get documentation for the add_member_to_group_or_project tool
get_documentation('add_member_to_group_or_project', site='gitlab', category='projects')

'"""\nAdds a user as a member to a GitLab group or project with specified access level and optional expiration date.\n    \n    Args:\n        id (str): The ID or URL-encoded path of the project or group\n        user_id (str): The user ID of the new member or multiple IDs separated by commas\n        access_level (int): A valid access level (e.g., 10=Guest, 20=Reporter, 30=Developer, 40=Maintainer, 50=Owner)\n        location_type (str, optional): Type of entity to add member to (\'group\' or \'project\').

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `add_member_to_group_or_project` tool allows us to add a user as a member to a GitLab project with a specified access level. The access level for a developer is `30`.

Let's call the `add_member_to_group_or_project` function to add both users to the project `a11y-webring.club` (project ID `179`) as developers.
CODE:
# Add abisubramanya27 as a developer to the project
response_abisubramanya27 = call_function(
    'add_member_to_group_or_project',
    site='gitlab',
    category='projects',
    id='179',
    user_id='5',
    access_level=30,
    location_type='project'
)

# Add lahwaacz as a developer to the project
response_lahwaacz = call_function(
    'add_member_to_group_or_project',
    site='gitlab',
    category='projects',
    id='179',
    user_id='1842',
    access_level=30,
