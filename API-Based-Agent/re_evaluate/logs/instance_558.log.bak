CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Create a repo named nolan_young_fans with movies directed by Christopher Nolan after 2010 in a README file***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='category') - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list tools in multiple categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

THOUGHT: To create a repository named `nolan_young_fans` with movies directed by Christopher Nolan after 2010 in a README file, I'll follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the `projects` category to find tools for creating a new project.
2. Use the appropriate tool to create a new project named `nolan_young_fans`.
3. List available tools in the `repository_files` category to find tools for creating or updating files in the repository.
4. Use the appropriate tool to create a README file with the list of movies directed by Christopher Nolan after 2010.

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The project `nolan_young_fans` has been successfully created with a README file. Now, we need to update the README file with the list of movies directed by Christopher Nolan after 2010.

Next, I'll list the tools in the `repository_files` category to find the tool for updating the README file.

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the available tools in the `repository_files` category do not include a direct method for updating a file. However, we can use the `get_raw_file` tool to retrieve the current content of the README file, and then we can update it with the new content.

Let's first retrieve the current content of the README file using the `get_raw_file` tool.

- The Dark Knight Rises (2012)
- Interstellar (2014)
- Dunkirk (2017)
- Tenet (2020)
- Oppenheimer (2023)

Next, I'll check for a tool to update the file content in the repository. Since the `repository_files` category didn't list a direct update tool, I'll explore the `projects` category again to see if there's a tool for updating files.

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To update the README file, I need to find a tool that allows file updates in the repository. Since the `repository_files` category didn't list a direct update tool, I'll explore the `repository_files` category again to see if there's a tool for updating files.

Let's proceed by listing the tools in the `repository_files` category again to ensure we didn't miss any tool for updating files.

Step 16:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the `repository_files` category does not list a tool for updating files directly. However, typically in GitLab, updating a file involves creating or updating a file with a commit. 

Let's try to find a tool that allows us to create or update a file in the repository. I'll explore the `repository_files` category documentation to see if there's a way to update files by creating or committing changes.

I'll proceed by checking the documentation for any tool that might allow file creation or updates.

Step 17:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the `upload_incident_metric_image` tool is not relevant for updating a README file. Since the `repository_files` category does not provide a direct tool for updating files, I will explore the `projects` category again to see if there is a tool for committing changes to a file.

Let's proceed by listing the tools in the `projects` category again to ensure we didn't miss any tool for committing changes.
CODE:
# List tools in the projects category again
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')

CONTENT: It seems that the `projects` category does not provide a direct tool for updating files either. However, typically in GitLab, updating a file involves creating or updating a file with a commit. 

Since the tools listed do not directly support file updates, I will attempt to use the `get_raw_file` tool to retrieve the current content of the README file, and then we can update it with the new content.
