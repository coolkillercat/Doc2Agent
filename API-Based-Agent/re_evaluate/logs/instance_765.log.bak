Step 4:

THOUGHT: To find the walkway to the closest Japanese food market from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, I will follow these steps:

1. **List Available Tools**: First, I will list the available tools for the 'map' site to see what functionalities are available for finding locations and directions.

2. **Examine API Documentation**: Once I identify the relevant tools, I will examine their documentation to understand how to use them effectively.

3. **Search for Japanese Food Markets**: I will use the appropriate API to search for Japanese food markets near the given address.

4. **Find the Closest Market**: After obtaining a list of markets, I will determine which one is closest to the specified address.

5. **Get Walkway Directions**: Finally, I will retrieve the walkway directions to the closest market.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the closest Japanese food market and get walkway directions, I will use the following approach:

1. **Search for Locations**: Use the `search_GET` tool to find Japanese food markets near the specified address.
2. **Find the Nearest Location**: Use the `nearest_service_GET` tool to determine the closest market.
3. **Get Walkway Directions**: Use the `route_service_GET` tool to get walkway directions to the closest market.

Let's start by examining the documentation for the `search_GET` tool to understand how to search for Japanese food markets.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_GET` tool allows us to search for locations using a free-form query or structured query parameters. To find Japanese food markets, I will use a free-form query with the term "Japanese food market" and specify the location as "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh."

Let's proceed with calling the `search_GET` function to search for Japanese food markets near the specified address.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for Japanese food markets near 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh
search_results = call_function(
    'search_GET',
    site='map',
    q='Japanese food market, 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh',
    format='json',
    limit=5,
    addressdetails=1
)

status_code: 200
content: []
parameter: q=Japanese food market, 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, format=json, limit=5, addressdetails=1
<Response [200]>

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search for "Japanese food market" near "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh" returned an empty result set. This could mean that there are no markets specifically labeled as "Japanese food market" in the database, or the query needs to be adjusted.

Let's try a broader search by looking for "Asian food market" instead, which might include Japanese markets as well. I'll perform this search next.
CODE:
# Search for Asian food markets near 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh
search_results_asian = call_function(
    'search_GET',
    site='map',
    q='Asian food market, 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh',
    format='json',
    limit=5,
    addressdetails=1
)
search_results_asian

url: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=Asian+food+market%2C+401+Shady+Ave%2C+Pittsburgh&format=json&limit=5&addressdetails=1&dedupe=1
status_code: 200
content: []
parameter: q=Asian food market, 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, format=json, limit=5, addressdetails=1
<Response [200]>

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search for "Asian food market" near "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh" also returned an empty result set. This suggests that there might not be any markets specifically labeled as "Asian food market" in the database, or the search query needs further adjustment.

To broaden the search, I will try looking for "grocery store" or "supermarket" which might include markets that sell Japanese or Asian food products. Let's proceed with this search.
CODE:
# Search for grocery stores near 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh
search_results_grocery = call_function(
    'search_GET',
    site='map',
    q='grocery store, 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh',
    format='json',
    limit=5,
    addressdetails=1
)

status_code: 200
content: []
parameter: q=grocery store, 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, format=json, limit=5, addressdetails=1
<Response [200]>

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search for "grocery store" near "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh" also returned an empty result set. This indicates that the search queries are not yielding results, possibly due to the specific labeling or categorization of locations in the database.

As an alternative approach, I will attempt to use the `nearest_service_GET` tool to find the nearest point of interest (POI) that might include grocery stores or markets. Let's first check the documentation for the `nearest_service_GET` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/nearest_service_GET.py
'"""\nFinds the nearest street segments for a given coordinate.\n    \n    Args:\n        coordinates (str): A string of format \'{longitude},{latitude}\'. Required.\n        number (int, optional): Number of nearest segments that should be returned. Defaults to 1.\n        profile (int, optional): Mode of transportation. 5000 for car, 5001 for bicycle, 5002 for foot. Defaults to 5000.\n    \n    Returns:\n        requests.Response: The response from the OSRM nearest service API.\n    \n    Example:\n        >>> nearest_service(coordinates=\'13.388860,52.517037\', number=3)\n        >>> nearest_service(coordinates=\'13.388860,52.517037\', number=1, profile=5001)\n""" example: nearest_service(coordinates=\'13.388860,52.517037\', number=3)'

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool is used to find the nearest street segments for a given coordinate. It allows specifying the mode of transportation, such as car, bicycle, or foot. However, it does not directly search for points of interest like markets or stores.

Since the previous searches did not yield results, I will attempt a different approach by using the `search_GET` tool with a broader query, such as "supermarket" or "market," which might include relevant locations.

Let's try searching for "supermarket" near "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh."
CODE:
# Search for supermarkets near 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh
search_results_supermarket = call_function(
    'search_GET',
    site='map',
    q='supermarket, 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh',
    format='json',
    limit=5,
    addressdetails=1
)

obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: search_GET

status_code: 200
content: []
parameter: q=supermarket, 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, format=json, limit=5, addressdetails=1
<Response [200]>

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search for "supermarket" near "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh" also returned an empty result set. This suggests that the database might not have detailed entries for supermarkets or similar points of interest in this area.

Given the limitations of the current search results, I will attempt a final approach by using the `search_GET` tool with a very general query, such as "market," to see if any results can be obtained.

Let's proceed with this search.
CODE:
# Search for markets near 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh
search_results_market = call_function(
    'search_GET',
    site='map',
    q='market, 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh',
