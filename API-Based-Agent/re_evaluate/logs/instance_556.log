CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Create a repo named nolan_honest_fans with movies directed by Christopher Nolan in a README file***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='category') - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list tools in multiple categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To create a repository named `nolan_honest_fans` with a README file containing movies directed by Christopher Nolan, we need to follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the `projects` category to find the tool for creating a new project.
2. Get documentation for the tool that allows us to create a new project.
3. Call the function to create the new project.
4. List available tools in the `repository_files` category to find the tool for creating a README file.
5. Get documentation for the tool that allows us to create a file in the repository.
6. Call the function to create a README file with the list of movies.

Let's start by listing the tools in the `projects` category.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have identified the `create_project` tool in the `projects` category, which will allow us to create a new GitLab project. Let's proceed by getting the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters for creating a project.
CODE:

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_project` tool allows us to create a new GitLab project with various customizable settings. We need to provide at least the `name` of the project and set `initialize_with_readme` to `True` to create a README file. Let's proceed to create the project named `nolan_honest_fans`.

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The project `nolan_honest_fans` has been successfully created with a README file. Now, we need to update the README file to include a list of movies directed by Christopher Nolan. Let's proceed by listing the tools in the `repository_files` category to find the tool for updating a file in the repository.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the `repository_files` category does not have a tool specifically for creating or updating files. However, the `get_raw_file` tool can retrieve the raw content of a file, which might be useful for verifying the content after updating it.

Since we need to update the README file, let's check if there is a tool in another category that allows us to create or update files in the repository. We should explore the `repositories` category to see if it contains the necessary tool.

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have found the `create_repository_file` tool in the `repositories` category, which allows us to create a new file in a repository with specified content. This tool will be useful for creating or updating the README file with the list of movies directed by Christopher Nolan.

Let's proceed by getting the documentation for the `create_repository_file` tool to understand the required parameters for creating or updating a file in the repository.

We need to provide the `project_id`, `file_path`, `content`, `branch`, and `commit_message`. Let's proceed to create or update the README file in the `nolan_honest_fans` repository with the list of movies directed by Christopher Nolan.

Here is the list of movies directed by Christopher Nolan that we will include in the README file:

Step 12:

THOUGHT: The response indicates that a file with the name `README.md` already exists in the repository. To update the existing file, we need to use a tool that allows us to update a file rather than create a new one. The `update_repository_file` tool in the `repositories` category should be used for this purpose.

Let's proceed by getting the documentation for the `update_repository_file` tool to understand the required parameters for updating a file in the repository.

We need to provide the `project_id`, `file_path`, `content`, `branch`, and `commit_message`. Let's proceed to update the README file in the `nolan_honest_fans` repository with the list of movies directed by Christopher Nolan.

Let's update the README file with the new content.
