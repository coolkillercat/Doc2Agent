Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Follow ['ghost', 'R1kk3r', 'Abishek'] on Gitlab***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:

CONTENT: To follow users on GitLab, we need to interact with the GitLab API to find and follow the specified users: 'ghost', 'R1kk3r', and 'Abishek'. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **List Available Tools in the Users Category**: We need to find tools related to user management to search for users and follow them.

2. **Get Documentation for Relevant Tools**: Once we identify the tools, we will check their documentation to understand how to use them.

3. **Search for Users**: Use the appropriate tool to search for the users by their usernames.

4. **Follow Users**: Use the tool to follow the users once we have their user IDs.

Let's start by listing the available tools in the 'users' category.

```python
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='users')

THOUGHT: We have a list of available tools in the 'users' category. To follow users, we need to:

1. **Search for Users**: Use the `list_users` tool to find the user IDs for 'ghost', 'R1kk3r', and 'Abishek'.

2. **Follow Users**: Use the appropriate tool to follow these users once we have their user IDs.

Let's start by getting the documentation for the `list_users` tool to understand how to search for users by their usernames.
