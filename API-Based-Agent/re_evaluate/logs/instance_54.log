Step 4:

THOUGHT: To determine the walking time from Carnegie Mellon University to the University of Pittsburgh, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to find the appropriate API for calculating walking time.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool to understand the required parameters.
3. Call the function with the appropriate parameters to get the walking time.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the walking time between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, the `route_service_GET` tool seems appropriate as it is used to find the fastest route between coordinates. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.

Step 6:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to find the fastest route between coordinates, and it supports different modes of transportation, including walking (profile '5002'). We need to provide the coordinates for Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.

Let's proceed with the following steps:
1. Determine the coordinates for both Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.
2. Use the `route_service_GET` tool with these coordinates and the walking profile to find the walking time.

I'll start by finding the coordinates for both locations.

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the coordinates for Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, I will use the `search_GET` tool, which allows searching for locations using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API. Let's start by finding the coordinates for Carnegie Mellon University.
