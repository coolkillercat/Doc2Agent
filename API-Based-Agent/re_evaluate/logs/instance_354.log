Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***List products from living room furtniture category by descending price***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To list products from the living room furniture category by descending price, I'll follow these steps:

1. List available API tools to find the appropriate tool for listing products.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool to understand how to use it.
3. Call the function to list products from the living room furniture category and sort them by descending price.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To list products from the living room furniture category by descending price, the tool `search_products_by_category_admin` seems appropriate. Let's check its documentation to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_category_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_products_by_category_admin.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_category_admin` tool allows us to find products in a specific category and sort them. We need to provide the `category_id` for the living room furniture, and we can sort by price in descending order.

Next, I'll call the function to list products from the living room furniture category by descending price. However, I need to know the `category_id` for living room furniture. If it's not provided, I'll assume a common ID or check if there's a way to retrieve it.

Let's proceed with calling the function assuming a hypothetical `category_id` for living room furniture. If this ID is incorrect, we may need to adjust it based on available data.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Assuming category_id for living room furniture is '10'
result = call_function('search_products_by_category_admin', site='shopping',
                       category_id='10',

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an internal error when trying to retrieve the products. This could be due to an incorrect `category_id` or an issue with the server.

To proceed, I will attempt to retrieve the correct `category_id` for the living room furniture category. If the tools available do not provide a direct way to get category IDs, I may need to make an educated guess or check if there's a tool to list categories.

Let's first check if there's a tool to list categories or retrieve category details.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there isn't a direct tool to list categories or retrieve category details. Since the `category_id` for living room furniture is not known, I will attempt to use the `search_products_by_name_admin` tool to find products related to "living room furniture" and sort them by price in descending order. This approach will help us achieve the goal indirectly.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_products_by_name_admin` tool to understand how to use it.

Step 10:

THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name_admin` tool allows us to search for products by name using a pattern. We can use this tool to search for products related to "living room furniture" and sort them by price in descending order.
