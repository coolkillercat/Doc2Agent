Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***I recently moved, my address is 111 Magnolia Path, Atlanta, GA, 30303, update my information on OneStopShopping accordingly***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

1. List available API tools to find the appropriate tool for updating customer information.
2. Check the documentation for the tool that allows updating customer information.
3. Use the tool to update your address.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To update your address, we need to find a tool that allows us to update customer information. The tool `search_customers_GET_admin` can be used to find your customer record, and then we can look for a tool to update your address.

Let's first check the documentation for `search_customers_GET_admin` to understand how to search for your customer record using your email address.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_customers_GET_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 7:

THOUGHT: The `search_customers_GET_admin` tool allows us to search for customers using various fields, including email. We can use this tool to find your customer record by searching with your email address.

Let's proceed to search for your customer record using your email address `emma.lopez@gmail.com`.
CODE:

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search for your customer record was successful. Your current address information is stored in the response, but it was truncated. Let's retrieve the full response to examine your current address details and then proceed to update it.

full_response = get_response('response_1')
print(full_response['items'][0]['addresses'])

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Your current address is listed as "101 S San Mateo Dr, San Mateo, CA, 94010". We need to update this to "111 Magnolia Path, Atlanta, GA, 30303".

Next, let's find a tool that allows us to update customer address information. I'll check the available tools for updating customer details.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
# Check the documentation for a tool that might allow updating customer information
get_documentation('set_customer_shipping_details', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `set_customer_shipping_details` tool allows us to set shipping and billing information for the customer's cart. However, it seems to be focused on cart operations rather than directly updating customer records.

Since we need to update your address in your customer profile, we should look for a tool specifically designed for updating customer information. Let's check if there is a tool for updating customer details directly.

I'll search for a tool that might allow updating customer information.
CODE:
# Check the documentation for a tool that might allow updating customer information
get_documentation('update_customer_address', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

"No module found for tool 'update_customer_address' in site 'shopping'"

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there isn't a specific tool named `update_customer_address`. However, we can use the `set_customer_shipping_details` tool to update the address information, as it allows setting shipping and billing details, which might reflect in the customer profile.

Let's proceed to update your address using the `set_customer_shipping_details` tool with the new address details.
CODE:
# Update the address using the set_customer_shipping_details tool
update_response = call_function('set_customer_shipping_details', site='shopping',
                                first_name="Emma",

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The attempt to update the address using the `set_customer_shipping_details` tool resulted in an error related to the shipping method. This tool seems to be specifically for cart operations, and it requires valid shipping methods.

Since there isn't a direct tool for updating customer addresses, we might need to explore other options or tools that could allow us to update customer information directly. Let's try to find another tool that might help with updating customer details.

I'll check the documentation for another tool that might allow updating customer information.
CODE:
# Check the documentation for a tool that might allow updating customer information
get_documentation('update_customer_details', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/update_customer_details.py

"No module found for tool 'update_customer_details' in site 'shopping'"

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears there isn't a specific tool named `update_customer_details` either. Given the available tools, it seems we might need to use a combination of tools or a different approach to update the customer address.

Since the `set_customer_shipping_details` tool is not suitable for directly updating customer profiles, and there isn't a direct tool for updating customer addresses, we might need to explore if there are any other tools that can handle customer updates or if there is a way to update the address through another method.

Let's try to find any other tool that might allow us to update customer information or address.
CODE:
# Check the documentation for any other tool that might allow updating customer information
get_documentation('update_customer_info', site='shopping')

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there isn't a direct tool available for updating customer information or addresses. Given the constraints, we might need to use the `search_customers_GET_admin` tool to retrieve the customer ID and address ID, and then use a different approach to update the address if possible.

Since the direct tools for updating customer information are not available, let's explore if there is any other tool or method that might allow us to update the address. I'll check the documentation for any other tool that might be relevant.
CODE:
# Check the documentation for any other tool that might allow updating customer information
