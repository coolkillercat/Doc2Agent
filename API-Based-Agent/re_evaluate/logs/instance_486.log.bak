CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Change the page title of "404 Not Found" page on my site to "Bruh bro you clicked the wrong page".***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The list of available tools for the `shopping_admin` site does not explicitly mention a tool for updating page titles or managing the 404 page. However, it's possible that such functionality might be part of a broader tool related to site configuration or content management.

To proceed, I'll search for any tool that might relate to site configuration or content management, which could potentially include page title updates. Let's check the documentation for any tool that seems relevant to this task.

I'll start by looking for tools related to site configuration or content management. If none are found, I'll explore other possibilities.
CODE:

get_documentation('get_enabled_modules_GET', site='shopping_admin')

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_enabled_modules_GET` tool provides a list of all enabled modules in the Magento installation, but it doesn't seem directly related to updating page titles or managing the 404 page.

Since this tool is not relevant, I'll need to explore other tools that might allow for content management or site configuration. Let's try checking the documentation for another tool that might be related to site configuration or content management.

I'll look into the `create_category_PUT` tool, as it might involve content management aspects.

THOUGHT: It seems that none of the tools explored so far are directly related to updating the page title of the "404 Not Found" page. Since the tools I've checked are not relevant, I'll need to continue searching for a tool that might allow for updating page titles or managing the 404 page.

Let's try checking the documentation for another tool that might be related to site configuration or content management. I'll look into the `get_custom_option_types_GET` tool, as it might involve site configuration aspects.

THOUGHT: It seems that none of the tools explored so far are directly related to updating the page title of the "404 Not Found" page. Since the tools I've checked are not relevant, and I have limited attempts left, I'll need to make a final attempt to find a tool that might allow for updating page titles or managing the 404 page.

Let's try checking the documentation for another tool that might be related to site configuration or content management. I'll look into the `get_enabled_modules_GET` tool, as it might involve site configuration aspects.
