CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***How many commits did Eric make between Feb 2023 and May 2023?***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To determine how many commits Eric made between February 2023 and May 2023, we need to follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the `projects` category to find the project ID.
2. Use the project ID to list tools in the `commits` category.
3. Retrieve the documentation for the relevant tool to get commit information.
4. Call the function to get commit data for the specified time range and filter by Eric's contributions.

Let's start by listing the tools in the `projects` category to find the project ID.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have a list of tools available in the `projects` category. To proceed, we need to find the project ID for the repository we are interested in. Let's use the `list_projects` tool to retrieve a list of projects and identify the one we need.

I'll get the documentation for the `list_projects` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
# Get documentation for the list_projects tool
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_projects` tool allows us to retrieve a list of GitLab projects with various filtering options. We can use this tool to find the project ID for the repository we are interested in.

Let's call the `list_projects` function to get a list of projects and identify the one we need.

THOUGHT: We have a list of tools available in the `commits` category. To retrieve a list of commits from a repository with filtering options, we can use the `list_repository_commits` tool.

Let's get the documentation for the `list_repository_commits` tool to understand how to use it.

Step 11:

THOUGHT: The `list_repository_commits` tool allows us to retrieve a list of commits from a project repository with filtering options such as date range and author. We can use this tool to find the number of commits Eric made between February 2023 and May 2023.

Let's call the `list_repository_commits` function with the appropriate parameters to get the commit data.
CODE:
# Call the list_repository_commits function to retrieve commits by Eric between Feb 2023 and May 2023
