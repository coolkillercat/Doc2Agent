THOUGHT: To find the nearest gas station from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), I will follow the API workflow:

1. First, I will list the available tools for the 'map' site to see what options are available for finding locations or places.
2. Then, I will examine the documentation for the relevant tool to understand how to use it.
3. Finally, I will call the appropriate function to find the nearest gas station.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the nearest gas station from CMU, the `nearest_service_GET` tool seems appropriate as it can snap a coordinate to the street network and return the nearest matches. 

Next, I will examine the documentation for the `nearest_service_GET` tool to understand how to use it effectively. Let's proceed with that step.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/nearest_service_GET.py

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool is used to find the nearest street segments for a given coordinate. It requires the following parameters:

- `coordinates`: A string in the format `{longitude},{latitude}`. This is required.
- `number`: The number of nearest segments to return. Defaults to 1.
- `profile`: The mode of transportation. Options are 5000 for car, 5001 for bicycle, and 5002 for foot. Defaults to 5000 (car).

To find the nearest gas station from CMU, I will use the coordinates for CMU and set the profile to 5000 (car). I will also set the number to 1 to find the single nearest match.

Let's proceed with calling the function using CMU's coordinates. CMU is located at approximately latitude 40.4433 and longitude -79.9436.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# CMU coordinates
coordinates = '-79.9436,40.4433'

Step 7:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The API call to `nearest_service_GET` was successful, and it returned the nearest street segment to the given coordinates of CMU. The response indicates the following:

- The nearest location is approximately 91.32 meters away from the specified coordinates.
- The location of the nearest point is at longitude -79.944656 and latitude 40.443142.

This location represents the nearest street segment, which is likely to be close to a gas station. However, the response does not directly provide the name of a gas station. To find the nearest gas station, we would typically need to use a service that provides place details or points of interest, which might not be directly available in the current toolset.

Given the current response, the nearest street segment is located at the coordinates provided, and you can use these coordinates to further explore nearby gas stations using a map service or application.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the nearest gas station, I will use the `search_GET` tool, which allows searching for locations using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API. This tool can help identify nearby gas stations by searching for relevant points of interest.

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_GET` tool allows us to search for locations using various parameters. To find the nearest gas station, we can use the `q` parameter with a query like "gas station" and specify the `format` as `json` for easy parsing. We can also use the `limit` parameter to restrict the number of results.

Let's proceed with calling the `search_GET` function to search for gas stations near CMU's coordinates.
CODE:
# Search for gas stations near CMU
search_result = call_function('search_GET', site='map', q='gas station near CMU', format='json', limit=1)
search_result

status_code: 200
content: []
parameter: q=gas station near CMU, format=json, limit=1
<Response [200]>

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search for "gas station near CMU" returned an empty result set. This might be due to the query not being specific enough or the search area not being correctly defined.

To improve the search, I will use a more structured query by specifying the city and using a bounding box around CMU to focus the search area. Let's try this approach by defining a bounding box around CMU and searching for gas stations within that area.

I'll proceed with this refined search.
CODE:
# Define a bounding box around CMU
# Approximate bounding box coordinates for CMU: (longitude, latitude)
viewbox = '-79.9500,40.4400,-79.9300,40.4500'  # A small area around CMU

# Search for gas stations within the bounding box
search_result_refined = call_function('search_GET', site='map', q='gas station', format='json', limit=1, viewbox=viewbox, bounded=1)
search_result_refined
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: search_GET

content: []
parameter: q=gas station, format=json, limit=1, viewbox=-79.9500,40.4400,-79.9300,40.4500, bounded=1
<Response [200]>

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The refined search using a bounding box around CMU also returned an empty result set. This suggests that the search parameters might still not be optimal for finding gas stations in the area.

As an alternative approach, I will attempt a broader search without the bounding box constraint and see if that yields any results. Let's try searching for gas stations in the city of Pittsburgh, where CMU is located, to see if we can get any results.

I'll proceed with this broader search.
CODE:
# Search for gas stations in Pittsburgh
search_result_broad = call_function('search_GET', site='map', q='gas station', city='Pittsburgh', format='json', limit=1)
