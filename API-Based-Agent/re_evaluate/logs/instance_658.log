CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Create an issue in a11yproject repo with title "401 bad gateway". Assign the issue to Roshanjossey. Set due date to be the end of 2030***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

THOUGHT: To create an issue in the "a11yproject" repository on GitLab, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the Project ID**: We need to identify the project ID for the "a11yproject" repository.
2. **Find the User ID**: We need to find the user ID for "Roshanjossey" to assign the issue.
3. **Create the Issue**: Use the project ID and user ID to create the issue with the specified title and due date.

Let's start by listing the available tools in the "projects" category to find the project ID.

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To create an issue, we need to use the `create_project_issue` tool. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
# Get documentation for the create_project_issue tool to create an issue
get_documentation('create_project_issue', site='gitlab', category='issues')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/issues/create_project_issue.py
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/workspace/api/gitlab/tools/issues/create_project_issue.py
"No module found for tool 'create_project_issue' in category 'issues' for site 'gitlab'"

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is no `create_project_issue` tool available in the "issues" category. However, we can use the `list_project_issues` tool to see if there are any existing issues and understand the structure. Let's check the documentation for the `list_project_issues` tool to see if it provides any insights or alternatives for creating an issue.
CODE:
# Get documentation for the list_project_issues tool to understand issue management
get_documentation('list_project_issues', site='gitlab', category='issues')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/issues/list_project_issues.py
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/workspace/api/gitlab/tools/issues/list_project_issues.py
"No module found for tool 'list_project_issues' in category 'issues' for site 'gitlab'"

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that there is no direct tool available for creating an issue in the "issues" category. However, we can try using the `create_project_issue` tool from the "projects" category, as it was listed earlier. Let's check the documentation for this tool to see if it can be used to create an issue.
CODE:
# Get documentation for the create_project_issue tool in the projects category
get_documentation('create_project_issue', site='gitlab', category='projects')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_project_issue` tool in the "projects" category allows us to create a new issue in a GitLab project with various customizable properties. We have the necessary information to create the issue:

- **Project ID**: 174
- **Title**: "401 bad gateway"
- **Assignee ID**: 2264 (Roshanjossey)
- **Due Date**: End of 2030 (2030-12-31)

Let's proceed to create the issue using these details.

# Call the create_project_issue function to create the issue
issue_creation_response = call_function(
