Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Get me my RSS feed token***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in a specific category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
# Then, get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
# Finally, call the function with appropriate parameters
call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id='183', commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the RSS feed token, we need to explore the available tools in the GitLab API related to user settings or tokens. Let's start by listing the tools available in the 'users' category, as this is likely where user-specific tokens would be managed.

I'll begin by listing the tools in the 'users' category.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'
DEBUG: Looking for GitLab subdirectory tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/tool_description.json

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The list of tools in the 'users' category does not explicitly mention an RSS feed token. However, it might be related to user preferences or personal access tokens. Let's check the documentation for the `get_user_preferences` tool to see if it includes any information about RSS feed tokens.

I'll proceed to get the documentation for the `get_user_preferences` tool.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('get_user_preferences', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/get_user_preferences.py
'"""\nRetrieves the authenticated user\'s preferences including settings for viewing diffs, showing whitespace, and passing identities to CI JWT.\n\n    Returns:\n        Returns the authenticated user\'s preferences including settings for viewing diffs, showing whitespace, and identity passing options.\n""" example: get_user_preferences()'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_user_preferences` tool retrieves user preferences related to viewing diffs, showing whitespace, and identity passing options, but it doesn't mention RSS feed tokens.

Since the RSS feed token might be related to personal access tokens or other user-specific settings, let's check the documentation for the `create_personal_access_token` tool to see if it provides any relevant information.

I'll proceed to get the documentation for the `create_personal_access_token` tool.
CODE:
get_documentation('create_personal_access_token', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/create_personal_access_token.py
'"""\nCreates a new personal access token for the currently authenticated user with k8s_proxy scope.\n    Returns the token details including the one-time accessible token value.\n    \n    Args:\n        name (str): Name of the personal access token\n        expires_at (str, optional): Expiration date of the access token in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).\n                    If not provided, the token expires at the end of the current day.\n    \n    Returns:\n        dict: The API response as a dictionary\n    \n    Example:\n        >>> create_personal_access_token(name="test_token", expires_at="2023-12-31")\n        {\n            "id": 3,\n            "name": "test_token",\n            "revoked": false,\n            "created_at": "2023-10-14T11:58:53.526Z",\n            "scopes": ["k8s_proxy"],\n            "user_id": 42,\n            "active": true,\n            "expires_at": "2023-12-31",\n            "token": "<your_new_access_token>"\n        }\n""" example: create_personal_access_token(name="test_token", expires_at="2023-12-31")'

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_personal_access_token` tool is used to create a new personal access token, but it doesn't seem directly related to retrieving an RSS feed token.

Since the RSS feed token is not explicitly mentioned in the tools we've explored, it might be categorized under a different tool or might be part of a miscellaneous category. Let's list the tools in the 'misc' category to see if there's anything related to RSS feed tokens.

I'll proceed to list the tools in the 'misc' category.
CODE:
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='misc')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'
DEBUG: Looking for GitLab subdirectory tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/misc/tool_description.json
DEBUG: File exists: True
DEBUG: Successfully read tool_description.json for misc
"Available tools in GitLab misc:\n- add_gpg_key: Adds a new GPG key to the authenticated user's account.\n- list_gpg_keys: Retrieves all GPG keys associated with the authenticated user's GitLab account.\n- update_invitation: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_resource_events: Retrieves events associated with a specific resource, with optional filtering by event type."

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The 'misc' category does not contain any tools that explicitly mention RSS feed tokens. Since the RSS feed token is not found in the categories we've explored, it might be part of the user information or settings.

Let's check the documentation for the `get_current_user` tool, as it might include comprehensive user information, including any tokens.

I'll proceed to get the documentation for the `get_current_user` tool.
CODE:
get_documentation('get_current_user', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/get_current_user.py
'"""\nRetrieves information about the currently authenticated user. Administrators can optionally retrieve information for a specific user by providing their ID in the sudo parameter.\n    \n    Args:\n        sudo_id (int, optional): ID of a user to make the call in their place. Defaults to None.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns detailed profile information about the currently authenticated user, including personal details, account settings, and activity statistics.\n""" example: get_current_user()'

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_current_user` tool retrieves detailed profile information about the currently authenticated user, including personal details, account settings, and activity statistics. This might include the RSS feed token.

Let's call the `get_current_user` function to see if it provides the RSS feed token.

I'll proceed to call the `get_current_user` function.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
call_function('get_current_user', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response from the `get_current_user` function was truncated. To find the RSS feed token, let's retrieve the full response and search for any mention of "RSS" or "token" within it.

I'll proceed to search for "RSS" and "token" in the full response.
CODE:
from utils import get_response
rss_token_info = get_response('response_1', 'RSS')
token_info = get_response('response_1', 'token')
(rss_token_info, token_info)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
("No matches found for 'RSS' in response_1",
 "No matches found for 'token' in response_1")

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the current user information does not include the RSS feed token directly. Since the RSS feed token is not found in the user profile or preferences, it might be part of a different category or require a specific tool that we haven't identified yet.

Let's try listing the tools in the 'misc' category again to ensure we didn't miss anything related to tokens or RSS feeds.

I'll proceed to list the tools in the 'misc' category once more.
CODE:
