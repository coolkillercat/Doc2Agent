CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***set the homepage URL on my GitLab profile to byteblaze.github.io***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To set the homepage URL on your GitLab profile, we need to interact with the GitLab API to update the user profile information. Let's follow the steps to achieve this:

1. First, we need to list the available tools in the "users" category to find the appropriate tool for updating user profile information.

Let's start by listing the tools in the "users" category.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To update the homepage URL on your GitLab profile, we need to find a tool that allows us to update user information. From the list of available tools in the "users" category, it seems we need to look for a tool that can update user preferences or profile information.

Let's check the documentation for the `update_user_preferences` tool to see if it allows updating the homepage URL.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('update_user_preferences', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/update_user_preferences.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `update_user_preferences` tool does not seem to support updating the homepage URL. We need to find another tool that allows us to update user profile information, specifically the homepage URL.

Let's check the documentation for the `get_current_user` tool to see if it provides information about the current user, which might include the homepage URL, and then we can look for a way to update it.
CODE:
get_documentation('get_current_user', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/get_current_user.py
'"""\nRetrieves information about the currently authenticated user. Administrators can optionally retrieve information for a specific user by providing their ID in the sudo parameter.\n    \n    Args:\n        sudo_id (int, optional): ID of a user to make the call in their place. Defaults to None.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns detailed profile information about the currently authenticated user, including personal details, account settings, and activity statistics.\n""" example: get_current_user()'

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_current_user` tool retrieves detailed profile information about the currently authenticated user, but it does not allow us to update the homepage URL.

Since we haven't found a tool specifically for updating the homepage URL, let's try listing all users to see if there is a tool that allows updating user information, which might include the homepage URL.

Let's check the documentation for the `list_users` tool to see if it provides any functionality related to updating user information.
CODE:
get_documentation('list_users', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/list_users.py

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_users` tool provides functionality to retrieve a list of GitLab users with various filtering options, but it does not allow updating user information.

Since none of the tools we've explored so far allow updating the homepage URL directly, let's try checking the documentation for the `get_user` tool to see if it provides any information about updating user details.
CODE:
get_documentation('get_user', site='gitlab', category='users')

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_user` tool retrieves detailed information about a specific user by their ID, but it does not provide functionality to update user details.

Since none of the tools we've explored so far allow updating the homepage URL directly, it seems we might be missing a tool specifically designed for updating user profile information.

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that none of the tools listed in the "users" category explicitly allow updating the homepage URL. However, there might be a tool that we have overlooked or a tool in another category that could help.

Let's try listing tools in the "misc" category, as it might contain miscellaneous tools that could include user profile updates.
