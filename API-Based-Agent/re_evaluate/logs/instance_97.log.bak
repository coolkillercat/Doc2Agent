CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to map and wikipedia. Answer the question: ***Tell me the distance to drive from Carnegie Mellon University to the top computer science school in massachusetts***
The site URL for map is http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000, use this instead of the normal map URL. 
The site URL for wikipedia is http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8888, use this instead of the normal wikipedia URL. 
For the map website, you will be provided with three sets of APIs, each providing different functionalities; 

For the map website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. get_documentation(tool_name, site='map') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
2. call_function(tool_name, site='map', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
3. call_direct(method, url, headers, body, site='map') - For custom API calls

**AVAILABLE TOOLS:**
Available tools:
- query_changesets_GET: This API method is used for querying changesets by different criteria. The results will match all the specified requirements.
- read_note_GET: Returns the existing note with the given ID.
- general_request_GET: All OSRM HTTP requests use a common structure.
- rss_feed_GET: Gets an RSS feed for notes within an area.
- ways_for_node_GET: Returns a XML document containing all the (not deleted) ways in which the given node is used.
- create_a_new_note_POST: Creates a new note at the specified location with the given text.
- get_element_history_GET: Retrieves all old versions of an element.
- place_details_GET: Show all details about a single place saved in the database. This API endpoint is meant for visual inspection of the data in the database, mainly together with Nominatim-UI.
- read_element_GET: Returns the XML or JSON representation of the element.
- get_element_version_GET: Retrieves a specific version of the element.
- match_service_GET: Map matching matches/snaps given GPS points to the road network in the most plausible way.
- route_service_GET: Finds the fastest route between coordinates in the supplied order.
- read_changeset_GET: Retrieves the changeset with the given id in OSM-XML format.
- full_GET: Retrieves a way or relation and all other elements referenced by it.
- relations_for_element_GET: Returns a XML document containing all (not deleted) relations in which the given element is used.
- get_user_details__json__GET: Retrieves details of the logged-in user in JSON format.
- table_service_GET: Computes the duration of the fastest route between all pairs of supplied coordinates.
- trip_service_GET: Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a greedy heuristic for 10 or more waypoints and uses brute force for less than 10 waypoints.
- tile_service_GET: Generates Mapbox Vector Tiles that can be viewed with a vector-tile capable slippy-map viewer.
- download_changeset_GET: Returns the OsmChange document describing all changes associated with the changeset.
- search_for_notes_GET: Returns notes that match the specified query.
- get_gps_points_GET: Retrieve the GPS track points that are inside a given bounding box.
- nearest_service_GET: Snaps a coordinate to the street network and returns the nearest n matches.
- retrieve_notes_by_bounding_box_GET: Returns existing notes in the specified bounding box.
- retrieving_map_data_by_bounding_box_GET: Returns all nodes inside a given bounding box and any relations that reference them, all ways that reference at least one node inside the bounding box, and any relations that reference them.
- search_GET: Search for locations using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API.
- address_lookup_GET: Query the address and other details of one or multiple OSM objects using Nominatim's lookup API.
- reverse_geocoding_GET: Reverse geocoding generates an address from a coordinate given as latitude and longitude.
- get_user_preferences__json__GET: Retrieves user preferences in JSON format.
- list_user_gpx_files_GET: Lists GPX files for the current user.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import get_documentation, call_function
# Get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('search_GET', site='map')
# Call the function with search parameters
results = call_function('search_GET', site='map', q='restaurants', format='json')
</execute_ipython>
For the wikipedia website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. get_documentation(tool_name, site='wikipedia') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
2. call_function(tool_name, site='wikipedia', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
3. call_direct(method, url, headers, body, site='wikipedia') - For custom API calls

**AVAILABLE TOOLS:**

- get_available_languages: Retrieves the list of all languages available in the ZIM file library as an OPDS Navigation Feed
- get_catalog_root: Retrieves the OPDS Catalog Root that links to all OPDS acquisition and navigation feeds available through the API
- get_content: Retrieves specific content from a ZIM file, with optional path parameter (empty path returns main page)
- get_entry_details: Retrieves full metadata information about a specific ZIM file identified by its UUID
- get_entry_illustration: Retrieves the illustration/cover image of specified size for a ZIM file identified by its UUID
