Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Lookup orders that are suspected of being fraudulent***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find orders suspected of being fraudulent, I will look for a tool that might help identify such orders. The tool `search_high_value_orders` could be relevant, as high-value orders are often flagged for fraud checks. Let's check the documentation for this tool to see if it can be used for fraud detection.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_high_value_orders', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_high_value_orders.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_high_value_orders` tool identifies orders with a total value above a specified threshold, which can be useful for fraud detection. I will use this tool to search for high-value orders that might be suspected of being fraudulent. I'll set a minimum amount threshold to identify potentially fraudulent orders.

Let's proceed with calling this function to find such orders.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Call the function to search for high-value orders
response = call_function('search_high_value_orders', site='shopping_admin',
                         minimum_amount=150.0,  # Example threshold for high-value orders
                         page_size=10,
                         sort_by='grand_total',
                         sort_direction='DESC',
                         return_fields=['increment_id', 'entity_id', 'customer_email', 'grand_total'])

THOUGHT: The response contains a list of high-value orders, which could be suspected of being fraudulent. The response was truncated, so I'll retrieve the full response to analyze the data.

Let's explore the full response to identify the orders.
CODE:

# Retrieve the full response for analysis
full_response = get_response('response_1')
full_response

Directly access specific values:\n   get_value_at_path(\'response_1\', \'[items][0][customer_email]\')\n   \n3.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To analyze the orders suspected of being fraudulent, I'll explore the data structure of the response to identify the relevant paths and extract the necessary information.

Let's list all available JSON paths in the response to understand its structure.
CODE:
from utils import list_all_paths

# List all available JSON paths in the response
list_all_paths('response_1')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
"Available paths in response_1 (depth ≤ 10):\n  [items]\n  [items][0]\n  [items][0][customer_email]\n  [items][0][entity_id]\n  [items][0][grand_total]\n  [items][0][increment_id]\n  [items][1]\n  [items][1][customer_email]\n  [items][1][entity_id]\n  [items][1][grand_total]\n  [items][1][increment_id]\n  [items][2]\n  [items][2][customer_email]\n  [items][2][entity_id]\n  [items][2][grand_total]\n  [items][2][increment_id]\n  [items][3]\n  [items][3][customer_email]\n  [items][3][entity_id]\n  [items][3][grand_total]\n  [items][3][increment_id]\n  [items][4]\n  [items][4][customer_email]\n  [items][4][entity_id]\n  [items][4][grand_total]\n  [items][4][increment_id]\n  [items][...] (5 more items, indices 5 to 9)\n\nFor arrays, you can access any index directly with get_value_at_path(), even if not shown above.\nExample: get_value_at_path('response_1', '[items][42][name]') will work if item 42 exists."

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Now that we have the structure of the response, I will extract the relevant information for each order, such as the customer email, order ID, and grand total, to identify the high-value orders that might be suspected of being fraudulent.

Let's extract and display this information.
CODE:
