act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Increase the price of this product by 10%***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool allows us to add or update product tier prices. To update the price of a product by 10%, we need to:

1. Identify the product SKU for which the price needs to be updated.
2. Retrieve the current price of the product.
3. Calculate the new price by increasing the current price by 10%.
4. Use the `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool to update the product price.

Let's start by searching for the product to get its current price. We'll use the `search_products` tool to find the product by name or other criteria.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products` tool allows us to search for products based on specified criteria. We can use this tool to find the product by its name or SKU to retrieve its current price.

Let's proceed by searching for the product using its name. Once we have the product details, we can calculate the new price and update it.

I'll call the `search_products` function to find the product.
CODE:

result = call_function('search_products', site='shopping_admin', field='name', value='Product Name', condition_type='like')

I'll perform another search using a wildcard pattern to see if we can find the product.
