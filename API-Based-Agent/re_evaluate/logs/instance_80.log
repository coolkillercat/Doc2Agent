Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To determine the duration required to first walk from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street, and then drive to Pittsburgh International Airport, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the map site to find the appropriate API for calculating travel durations.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tools to understand the required parameters and usage.
3. Use the appropriate API calls to calculate the walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street.
4. Use the appropriate API calls to calculate the driving duration from Starbucks on Craig Street to Pittsburgh International Airport.
5. Sum the durations to get the total travel time.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the map site.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To calculate the travel durations, the most relevant tools appear to be `route_service_GET` for finding the fastest route between coordinates and `table_service_GET` for computing the duration of the fastest route between pairs of coordinates.

Next, I will check the documentation for the `route_service_GET` tool to understand how to use it for calculating the walking and driving durations. Let's proceed with that.
CODE:

get_documentation('route_service_GET', site='map')

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to get the fastest route between coordinates using different transportation profiles such as 'car', 'bike', or 'foot'. We can specify the coordinates in the format `{longitude},{latitude};{longitude},{latitude}`.

To calculate the durations, we need to:
1. Use the `route_service_GET` tool with the 'foot' profile to find the walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street.
2. Use the `route_service_GET` tool with the 'driving' profile to find the driving duration from Starbucks on Craig Street to Pittsburgh International Airport.

First, let's calculate the walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street. I'll use the coordinates for these locations and call the API.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
