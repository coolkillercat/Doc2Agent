CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Today is 3/15/2023, generate a tax report for this year***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To generate a tax report for 2023, we need to find tools related to orders and invoices, as these typically contain tax information. Based on the available tools, the following seem relevant:

- `list_orders_GET`: Lists orders that match specified search criteria.
- `search_invoices_by_date_range`: Searches for invoices created within a specific date range, useful for financial reporting.

I'll start by checking the documentation for `search_invoices_by_date_range` to understand how to use it for retrieving invoices from 2023. This will help us gather the necessary data for the tax report.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_invoices_by_date_range', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_invoices_by_date_range.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_invoices_by_date_range` tool allows us to search for invoices created within a specific date range, which is perfect for generating a tax report for 2023. We can specify the start and end dates, and optionally include pagination and sorting options.

Let's proceed by calling this function to retrieve all invoices from January 1, 2023, to March 15, 2023. This will provide us with the necessary data to generate the tax report.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Call the function to retrieve invoices from January 1, 2023, to March 15, 2023
response = call_function(
    'search_invoices_by_date_range',
    site='shopping_admin',
    start_date='2023-01-01 00:00:00',
    end_date='2023-03-15 23:59:59',
    page_size=100,  # Assuming a large page size to retrieve more data at once
    sort_by='created_at',
    sort_direction='ASC'
)

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response indicates that the API call was successful, but the content of the response is truncated. To proceed, I'll explore the structure of the response to understand the available data paths and then extract the necessary information for the tax report.

Let's list all available JSON paths in the response to see what data we have.
CODE:
from utils import list_all_paths
list_all_paths('response_1')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
'Available paths in response_1 (depth ≤ 10):\n  [items]\n  [search_criteria]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][0]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][0][filters]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][0][filters][0]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][0][filters][0][field]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][0][filters][0][value]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][0][filters][0][condition_type]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][1]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][1][filters]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][1][filters][0]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][1][filters][0][field]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][1][filters][0][value]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][1][filters][0][condition_type]\n  [search_criteria][sort_orders]\n  [search_criteria][sort_orders][0]\n  [search_criteria][sort_orders][0][field]\n  [search_criteria][sort_orders][0][direction]\n  [search_criteria][page_size]\n  [total_count]'

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response structure indicates that we have a list of items (invoices) and search criteria details. However, it seems that the `items` list is empty, which means there are no invoices found within the specified date range.

To ensure that we have covered all possibilities, let's verify the `total_count` to confirm whether there are any invoices at all for the specified period. This will help us determine if the data retrieval was successful or if there are genuinely no invoices.

I'll extract the `total_count` to confirm this.
CODE:
from utils import get_value_at_path
total_count = get_value_at_path('response_1', '[total_count]')
total_count
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 10:
