Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To compare the time for walking and driving routes from AMC Waterfront to the University of Pittsburgh, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to find relevant APIs for route information.
2. Check the documentation for the tools that can provide route information for walking and driving.
3. Use the appropriate API calls to get the time for both walking and driving routes.
4. Compare the times and provide the result.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the fastest route between coordinates, we can use the `route_service_GET` tool. This tool should allow us to get route information for both walking and driving.

Next, I'll check the documentation for the `route_service_GET` tool to understand how to use it for both walking and driving routes.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('route_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 6:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to find the fastest route between coordinates. It supports different transportation modes through the `profile` parameter, where '5000' is for car, '5001' is for bicycle, and '5002' is for foot.

To compare the walking and driving times, I will:
1. Use the `route_service_GET` tool to get the driving route time from AMC Waterfront to the University of Pittsburgh.
2. Use the same tool to get the walking route time between the same locations.
3. Compare the two times.

First, let's find the coordinates for AMC Waterfront and the University of Pittsburgh. Then, I'll call the API for the driving route.

Step 8:

Let's start by finding the coordinates for these locations using the `search_GET` tool, which can help us search for locations using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API.

I'll first search for the coordinates of AMC Waterfront.
