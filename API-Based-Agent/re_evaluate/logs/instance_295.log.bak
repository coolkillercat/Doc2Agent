Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Show me the command to clone metaseq with SSH.***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in a specific category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
# Then, get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
# Finally, call the function with appropriate parameters
call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id='183', commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the command to clone the "metaseq" repository with SSH from GitLab, I will follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the "projects" category to find tools related to repositories.
2. Check the documentation for a tool that can provide repository information.
3. Use the appropriate tool to get the SSH URL for the "metaseq" project.

Let's start by listing the tools in the "projects" category.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool `get_project_details` seems to be the one that can provide detailed information about a specific project, including repository URLs. I will now check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it to get the SSH URL for the "metaseq" project.

Let's proceed by getting the documentation for the `get_project_details` tool.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('get_project_details', site='gitlab', category='projects')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/projects/get_project_details.py
'"""\nRetrieves detailed information about a specific project, including description, visibility, repository URLs, and other project metadata. Useful for project management and monitoring.\n    \n    Args:\n        project_id: The ID of the project to retrieve\n        include_license: Include project license data\n        include_statistics: Include project statistics (requires at least Reporter role)\n        include_custom_attributes: Include custom attributes in response (administrators only)\n        \n    Returns:\n        Retrieves detailed information about a specific project, including description, visibility, repository URLs, and other project metadata.\n""" example: get_project_details(project_id=183, include_statistics=True)'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_project_details` tool retrieves detailed information about a specific project, including repository URLs. To find the SSH URL for the "metaseq" project, I need to call this function with the appropriate project ID.

Next, I'll use the `get_project_details` tool to retrieve the details for the "metaseq" project. However, I need to know the project ID for "metaseq". I will first search for the project to get its ID.

Let's search for the "metaseq" project to find its ID.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Search for the "metaseq" project to find its ID
call_function('search_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects', search='metaseq')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: search_projects
site: gitlab
category: projects

 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 8:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The search for the "metaseq" project was successful, and I found the SSH URL directly in the response. The SSH URL for the "metaseq" project is:

`ssh://git@ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:2222/root/metaseq.git`

This is the command you can use to clone the "metaseq" repository with SSH:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:2222/root/metaseq.git
```

Finish[git clone ssh://git@ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:2222/root/metaseq.git]
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 9:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 10:
act - AgentFinishAction(outputs={}, thought='Finish[git clone ssh://git@ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:2222/root/metaseq.git]  <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>', action='finish')
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')
