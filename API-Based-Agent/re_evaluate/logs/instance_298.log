Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Show the most recent completed order***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To find the most recent completed order, I'll start by listing the available API tools for the shopping site. This will help identify the appropriate tool to retrieve order information.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the most recent completed order, I will use the `search_orders_by_status_admin` tool, which allows searching for orders with a specific status. I'll first check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_orders_by_status_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_orders_by_status_admin.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_status_admin` tool allows us to search for orders with a specific status, such as 'complete'. It supports pagination and sorting, which will be useful to find the most recent order. I'll proceed to call this function to search for completed orders, sorting by the creation date in descending order to get the most recent one.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
