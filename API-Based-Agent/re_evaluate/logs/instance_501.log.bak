CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Make all Taurus Elements Shell as out of stock***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: To proceed with making all "Taurus Elements Shell" products out of stock, I'll follow these steps:

1. Use the `search_products_by_name` tool to find products with the name "Taurus Elements Shell".
2. Use the `update_stock_item_PUT` tool to update the stock status of these products to "out of stock".

First, I'll check the documentation for the `search_products_by_name` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name` tool allows us to search for products using a name pattern with SQL LIKE syntax. We can use `%` as a wildcard to match parts of the product name.

act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search for "Taurus Elements Shell" products returned several items with different SKUs. Now, I need to update the stock status of these products to "out of stock" using the `update_stock_item_PUT` tool.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `update_stock_item_PUT` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('update_stock_item_PUT', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `update_stock_item_PUT` tool allows us to update stock information for a product by specifying the SKU, item ID, and stock information. The stock information includes the quantity (`qty`) and whether the item is in stock (`is_in_stock`).

To proceed, I need to:
1. Retrieve the full list of SKUs for "Taurus Elements Shell" products.
2. Use the `update_stock_item_PUT` tool to set `is_in_stock` to `False` for each SKU.

First, I'll retrieve the full list of SKUs from the stored response.
CODE:
from utils import get_response, search_key
# Retrieve the full response data
response_data = get_response('response_1')

# Extract SKUs from the response
skus = [item['sku'] for item in response_data['items']]
skus

      5 # Extract SKUs from the response
----> 6 skus = [item['sku'] for item in response_data['items']]
      7 skus

TypeError: string indices must be integers

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error in accessing the response data. The response content might be a string, so I need to parse it correctly. Let's explore the structure of the response to understand how to access the SKUs.

I'll use `list_all_paths` to explore the structure of the response.
CODE:
from utils import list_all_paths
# Explore the structure of the response to find the correct path for SKUs
list_all_paths('response_1')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
"Available paths in response_1 (depth ≤ 10):\n  [items]\n  [items][0]\n  [items][0][sku]\n  [items][0][name]\n  [items][1]\n  [items][1][sku]\n  [items][1][name]\n  [items][2]\n  [items][2][sku]\n  [items][2][name]\n  [items][3]\n  [items][3][sku]\n  [items][3][name]\n  [items][4]\n  [items][4][sku]\n  [items][4][name]\n  [items][...] (11 more items, indices 5 to 15)\n\nFor arrays, you can access any index directly with get_value_at_path(), even if not shown above.\nExample: get_value_at_path('response_1', '[items][42][name]') will work if item 42 exists."

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response structure shows that the SKUs are located under the path `[items][index][sku]`. I will now extract the SKUs using this path and proceed to update their stock status.

Let's extract the SKUs from the response.
CODE:
from utils import get_value_at_path

# Extract SKUs from the response
skus = [get_value_at_path('response_1', f'[items][{i}][sku]') for i in range(16)]
skus

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: I have successfully extracted the SKUs for the "Taurus Elements Shell" products. Now, I will proceed to update the stock status for each of these SKUs to "out of stock" using the `update_stock_item_PUT` tool.

I'll start by updating the stock status for the first SKU as an example, and then I will apply the same process to the rest.

Let's update the stock status for the first SKU.
CODE:
# Update stock status for the first SKU
update_response = call_function('update_stock_item_PUT', site='shopping_admin',

Step 13:
