Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***What is the price range of Canon photo printer in the One Stop Market?***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the price range of Canon photo printers in the One Stop Market, I'll follow the API workflow:

1. List available tools to find the appropriate one for searching products.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool to understand how to use it.
3. Call the function to search for Canon photo printers and determine their price range.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the price range of Canon photo printers, we need to search for products using the appropriate tool. Based on the available tools, the `search_products_by_name_admin` tool seems suitable for searching products by name.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_products_by_name_admin` tool to understand how to use it for searching Canon photo printers.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_name_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_products_by_name_admin.py
'"""\nSearches for products whose names match a specific pattern using SQL LIKE syntax.\n    \n    Args:\n        name_pattern (str): The pattern to search for in product names (SQL LIKE syntax, % is used as wildcard)\n        page_size (int, optional): Maximum number of items to return\n        current_page (int, optional): Current page of results\n        sort_by (str, optional): Field to sort by\n        sort_direction (str, optional): Sort direction, \'ASC\' or \'DESC\'\n        return_fields (list, optional): List of fields to return in the response\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of products with their SKUs, names, and prices that match the specified search pattern.\n""" example: search_products_by_name("%Tee%", page_size=10, sort_by="name", sort_direction="ASC", return_fields=["name", "sku", "price"])'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name_admin` tool allows us to search for products using a name pattern with SQL LIKE syntax. We can use `%` as a wildcard to match parts of the product name.

Let's search for Canon photo printers by using a name pattern like `%Canon%Photo%Printer%` to capture variations in naming. We'll also specify the fields we want to return, such as the product name and price.

I'll proceed with calling the function to search for Canon photo printers.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for Canon photo printers
result = call_function(
    'search_products_by_name_admin',
    site='shopping',
    name_pattern='%Canon%Photo%Printer%',
    page_size=50,
    sort_by='price',
    sort_direction='ASC',
    return_fields=['name', 'price']
)

print(result)

Step 8:

THOUGHT: The response was truncated, so I'll retrieve the full response to analyze the price range of Canon photo printers.

Let's get the full response to determine the price range.

full_response = get_response('response_1')
full_response_items = full_response['items']

# Extract prices to determine the range
prices = [item['price'] for item in full_response_items]
price_range = (min(prices), max(prices))
