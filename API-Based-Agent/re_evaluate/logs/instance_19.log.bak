Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To compare the time for walking and driving routes from Carnegie Science Center to Carnegie Mellon University, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to find relevant APIs for route information.
2. Check the documentation for the tools that can provide route information for both walking and driving.
3. Use the appropriate API to get the walking route time.
4. Use the appropriate API to get the driving route time.
5. Compare the times and provide the result.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the fastest route between coordinates, the `route_service_GET` tool seems appropriate. I will now check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it for both walking and driving routes.

Let's get the documentation for the `route_service_GET` tool.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('route_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to find the fastest route between coordinates with different transportation modes. The `profile` parameter specifies the mode of transportation, where `'5000'` is for car, `'5001'` is for bicycle, and `'5002'` is for foot.

To compare the walking and driving times, I will:
1. Use the `route_service_GET` tool with the `profile` set to `'5000'` for driving.
2. Use the `route_service_GET` tool with the `profile` set to `'5002'` for walking.

First, let's find the driving route time from Carnegie Science Center to Carnegie Mellon University. I'll use the coordinates for these locations:
- Carnegie Science Center: Longitude: -80.0158, Latitude: 40.4457
- Carnegie Mellon University: Longitude: -79.9425, Latitude: 40.4445

Let's call the API for the driving route.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Coordinates for Carnegie Science Center and Carnegie Mellon University
coordinates = '-80.0158,40.4457;-79.9425,40.4445'

# Call the route_service_GET for driving
driving_route = call_function('route_service_GET', site='map', coordinates=coordinates, profile='5000')
