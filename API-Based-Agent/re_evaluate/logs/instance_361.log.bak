Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Show me the order statuses for order number 170 and 189.***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the order statuses for order numbers 170 and 189, I'll follow the API workflow:

1. List available tools to find the appropriate one for retrieving order statuses.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool.
3. Call the function to get the order statuses.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'shopping'

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To retrieve the order statuses for order numbers 170 and 189, the tool `get_order_by_id_admin` seems appropriate as it retrieves detailed information about a specific order by its ID. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('get_order_by_id_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/get_order_by_id_admin.py
'"""\nRetrieves detailed information about a specific order by its ID, with option to specify which fields to return.\n    \n    Args:\n        order_id (int): The ID of the order to retrieve\n        return_fields (list, optional): List of fields to include in the response. If None, all fields are returned.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns detailed order information including customer email, order ID, and status for a specific order.\n""" example: get_order_by_id(3, [\'increment_id\', \'customer_email\', \'status\'])'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_order_by_id_admin` tool allows us to retrieve detailed information about a specific order by its ID. We can specify which fields to return, such as `increment_id`, `customer_email`, and `status`.

Let's proceed to call this function for order numbers 170 and 189 to get their statuses.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Retrieve order status for order number 170
order_170 = call_function('get_order_by_id_admin', site='shopping', order_id=170, return_fields=['increment_id', 'status'])

# Retrieve order status for order number 189
order_189 = call_function('get_order_by_id_admin', site='shopping', order_id=189, return_fields=['increment_id', 'status'])

(order_170, order_189)

[Response stored as 'response_2' - use get_response('response_2', 'search_term') to search within it]
({'status_code': 200,
  'content': {'increment_id': '000000170', 'status': 'canceled'},
  'url': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7770/rest/default/V1/orders/170?fields=increment_id%2Cstatus',

obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')
