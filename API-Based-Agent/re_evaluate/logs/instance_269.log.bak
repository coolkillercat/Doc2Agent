Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Show me products under $25 in "women shoes" category***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To find products under $25 in the "women shoes" category, I'll follow the API workflow:

1. List available tools to find the appropriate API for searching products.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool to understand the required parameters.
3. Call the function to search for products in the specified category and price range.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find products under $25 in the "women shoes" category, I will use the following approach:

1. Use the `search_products_by_category_admin` tool to find products in the "women shoes" category.
2. Use the `search_products_by_price_range_admin` tool to filter products under $25.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `search_products_by_category_admin` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_category_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_products_by_category_admin.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_category_admin` tool allows us to find all products belonging to a specific category by using the category ID. We need to know the category ID for "women shoes" to proceed.

Next, I'll check the documentation for the `search_products_by_price_range_admin` tool to understand how to filter products under $25.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_price_range_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_price_range_admin` tool allows us to search for products within a specified price range. We can use this tool to filter products under $25.

To proceed, I need to:
1. Identify the category ID for "women shoes."
2. Use the `search_products_by_category_admin` tool to find products in that category.
3. Use the `search_products_by_price_range_admin` tool to filter those products under $25.

Let's start by finding the category ID for "women shoes." I'll use the `search_products_by_category_admin` tool to search for products in the "women shoes" category. Since I don't have the category ID, I'll assume a common category ID for demonstration purposes. If needed, I can adjust this based on the actual category structure.

I'll proceed with calling the function to search for products in the "women shoes" category.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Assuming a common category ID for "women shoes" for demonstration
category_id = 'women_shoes_category_id'  # Replace with actual ID if known

# Call the function to search for products in the "women shoes" category
products_in_category = call_function('search_products_by_category_admin', site='shopping',
                                     category_id=category_id,
                                     page_size=50,
                                     current_page=1)
print(products_in_category)

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search for products in the "women shoes" category returned no results, likely due to an incorrect or placeholder category ID. To proceed, I need to ensure that the correct category ID is used.

Since I don't have the actual category ID for "women shoes," I'll attempt to use the `search_products_by_price_range_admin` tool directly to find products under $25, and then filter for those that might belong to the "women shoes" category based on their names or descriptions.

Let's proceed with searching for products under $25.
CODE:
# Call the function to search for products under $25
products_under_25 = call_function('search_products_by_price_range_admin', site='shopping',
                                  min_price=0.0,

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search for products under $25 returned a list of items. However, the response was truncated, so I need to retrieve the full response to identify products specifically related to "women shoes."

I'll retrieve the full response and search for "shoes" within it to find relevant products.
CODE:
from utils import get_response

# Retrieve the full response and search for "shoes"
full_response = get_response('response_2')
shoe_products = get_response('response_2', 'shoes')
print(shoe_products)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
Search results for 'shoes' in response_2 (3 matches):
