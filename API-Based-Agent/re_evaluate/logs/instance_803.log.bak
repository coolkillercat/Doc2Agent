act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***create a new group "webagent" with members pandey2000, sayakpaul, sayakpaul***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To create a new group "webagent" with members "pandey2000" and "sayakpaul" in GitLab, I will follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the "groups" category to find the tool for creating a new group.
2. Get the documentation for the tool that allows creating a new group.
3. Call the function to create the group "webagent".
4. List available tools in the "members" category to find the tool for adding members to a group.
5. Get the documentation for the tool that allows adding members to a group.
6. Call the function to add the members "pandey2000" and "sayakpaul" to the "webagent" group.

Let's start by listing the available tools in the "groups" category.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: The tool we need to create a new group is `create_group`. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters for creating a group.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('create_group', site='gitlab', category='groups')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_group` tool allows us to create a new project group in GitLab with various customizable settings. The required parameters for creating a group are:

- `name`: The name of the group
- `path`: The path of the group

Optional parameters include `description`, `visibility`, and others for specific configurations.

Next, I'll call the function to create the group "webagent" with the necessary parameters.
CODE:

group_creation_response = call_function(
    'create_group',
    site='gitlab',

    name='webagent',
    path='webagent',
    description='Group for web agents',

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The group "webagent" has been successfully created with the ID 2626. Now, let's proceed to add members "pandey2000" and "sayakpaul" to this group.

First, I'll list the available tools in the "members" category to find the tool for adding members to a group.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool we need to add members to a group is `invite_member`. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters for adding members to a group.

- `id`: The ID of the group to add the member to.
- `access_level`: A valid access level for the new member.
- `email`: The email of the new member (required if user_id is not provided).

For this task, I'll assume a standard access level for members, which is typically "Developer" with an access level of 30. Now, I'll proceed to invite the members "pandey2000" and "sayakpaul" to the "webagent" group using their email addresses.

Let's start by inviting "pandey2000".
CODE:
