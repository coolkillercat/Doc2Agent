Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Checkout merge requests assigned to me***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in a specific category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
# Then, get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
# Finally, call the function with appropriate parameters
call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id='183', commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 2:

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To checkout merge requests assigned to you in GitLab, we need to follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the `merge_requests` category to find the appropriate tool for retrieving merge requests.
2. Get the documentation for the tool that allows us to list merge requests assigned to a specific user.
3. Call the function to retrieve the merge requests assigned to you.

Let's start by listing the available tools in the `merge_requests` category.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='merge_requests')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool we need to use is `list_merge_requests`, which allows us to retrieve merge requests based on specified filters, including assignee. Let's proceed by getting the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it to find merge requests assigned to you.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('list_merge_requests', site='gitlab', category='merge_requests')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/merge_requests/list_merge_requests.py

Useful for tracking work in progress, reviewing code contributions, or monitoring merge request status.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of merge requests with detailed information including ID, title, state, branches, author details, and merge status.\n""" example: list_merge_requests(scope=\'all\', state=\'opened\', author_id=2330)'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_merge_requests` tool allows us to retrieve merge requests based on various filters, including assignee. To find merge requests assigned to you, we need to specify the appropriate filter for the assignee.

Let's proceed by calling the `list_merge_requests` function with the necessary parameters to retrieve merge requests assigned to you. We will assume that the assignee filter can be specified using an appropriate parameter, such as `assignee_id`.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Assuming 'assignee_id' is the parameter to filter merge requests assigned to a specific user
# Replace 'your_user_id' with the actual user ID for the current user
result = call_function('list_merge_requests', site='gitlab', category='merge_requests', assignee_id='your_user_id', state='opened')
print(result)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: list_merge_requests
site: gitlab

parameter: assignee_id=your_user_id, state=opened

status_code: 400
content: {
  "error": "assignee_id should be an integer, none, or any, however got your_user_id"
}

[Response stored as 'response_1' - use get_response('response_1', 'search_term') to search within it]

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the `assignee_id` parameter requires an integer value, which should be the actual user ID of the assignee. Let's proceed by retrieving the user ID for the current user, which we can then use to filter the merge requests assigned to you.

First, we need to list the available tools in the `users` category to find a tool that can help us retrieve the current user's ID.
CODE:
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'

Step 9:

THOUGHT: To retrieve the current user's ID, we can use the `get_current_user` tool, which provides information about the authenticated user. Let's proceed by getting the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.

Step 10:
