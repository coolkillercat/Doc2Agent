Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Which number to call for the customer service?***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 2:

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the customer service number for the shopping website, I'll start by listing the available API tools to see if there is a tool that provides contact information.

Let's begin by listing the available tools for the shopping site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='shopping')

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the customer service number, I need to identify a tool that might provide contact information or customer service details. Based on the list of available tools, none of them explicitly mention customer service or contact information.

However, I will check the documentation for the `search_customers_GET_admin` tool to see if it might provide any relevant information about customer service or contact details.

Let's proceed by examining the documentation for the `search_customers_GET_admin` tool.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_customers_GET_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_customers_GET_admin.py
'"""\nSearch for customers based on specified criteria.\n    \n    Args:\n        field (str): The field to filter by (e.g., \'email\', \'firstname\', \'lastname\')\n        value (str): The value to filter for\n        condition_type (str): The condition type for filtering (e.g., \'eq\', \'like\', \'gt\')\n        sort_field (str): Field to sort results by (e.g., \'created_at\', \'email\')\n        sort_direction (str): Direction to sort (\'ASC\' or \'DESC\')\n        page_size (int): Number of results per page\n        current_page (int): Current page number\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns customer records matching the specified search criteria with their personal information, addresses, and account details.\n    Example:\n        >>> search_customers(field=\'email\', value=\'example@example.com\')\n        >>> search_customers(field=\'firstname\', value=\'John\', sort_field=\'created_at\', sort_direction=\'DESC\')\n""" example: search_customers(field=\'email\', value=\'emma.lopez@gmail.com\', sort_field=\'created_at\', sort_direction=\'ASC\')'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_customers_GET_admin` tool allows searching for customers based on specified criteria, such as email, first name, or last name. It returns customer records with personal information, addresses, and account details. However, it doesn't explicitly mention providing customer service contact information.

Since the available tools and documentation do not directly provide a customer service number, it might be part of the customer records or account details. I will proceed to search for the customer record using the email `emma.lopez@gmail.com` to see if it includes any contact information that might help.

Let's search for Emma Lopez's customer record.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
result = call_function('search_customers_GET_admin', site='shopping',
                      field='email',
                      value='emma.lopez@gmail.com',
                      condition_type='eq')

Step 8:
