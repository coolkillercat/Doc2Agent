Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***List products from PS4 accessories category by ascending price***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

THOUGHT: To list products from the PS4 accessories category by ascending price, I'll follow the API workflow:

1. List available tools to find the appropriate one for listing products.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool to understand how to use it.
3. Call the function to list products in the PS4 accessories category, sorted by ascending price.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool `search_products_by_category_admin` seems to be the most relevant for finding products in a specific category, such as PS4 accessories. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_category_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_products_by_category_admin.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_category_admin` tool allows us to find all products belonging to a specific category. It supports sorting by a specified field and direction. To list products from the PS4 accessories category by ascending price, we need to know the category ID for PS4 accessories.

Assuming we have the category ID for PS4 accessories, we can proceed to call the function with the following parameters:
- `category_id`: The ID for PS4 accessories
- `sort_by`: 'price'
- `sort_direction`: 'ASC'

Let's proceed with calling the function using these parameters. If the category ID is not known, we may need to find it first. For now, I'll assume a placeholder ID and proceed with the call.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Assuming the category ID for PS4 accessories is '123'
result = call_function('search_products_by_category_admin', site='shopping',
                       category_id='123',
                       sort_by='price',
                       sort_direction='ASC')
print(result)

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an internal error when attempting to retrieve the products. This could be due to an incorrect category ID or an issue with the server. To proceed, we should verify the correct category ID for PS4 accessories.

Let's search for the correct category ID using the available tools. I'll look for a tool that can help us retrieve category information.
CODE:

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems I mistakenly repeated the documentation retrieval for the same tool. To find the correct category ID for PS4 accessories, I need to look for a tool that can help retrieve category information. Let's explore the available tools again to find one that can list categories or provide category details.

I'll check the list of available tools once more to identify a suitable tool for retrieving category information.

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there isn't a direct tool listed for retrieving category information. However, the `catalog_view_search_admin` tool might be useful for retrieving products from specific categories with optional filters. Let's check the documentation for this tool to see if it can help us identify the correct category ID for PS4 accessories.

I'll proceed to get the documentation for the `catalog_view_search_admin` tool.
CODE:

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `catalog_view_search_admin` tool allows us to retrieve products from specific categories using category IDs. However, it requires knowing the category ID beforehand. Since we don't have a direct way to list categories, we might need to make an assumption or use a known category ID for PS4 accessories.

Given the current situation, let's attempt to use a placeholder category ID and see if we can retrieve any products. If this doesn't work, we may need to explore other options or tools.

I'll proceed to call the `catalog_view_search_admin` tool with a placeholder category ID for PS4 accessories.
CODE:

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response indicates that no products were found using the placeholder category ID `123`. This suggests that the ID might be incorrect or that there are no products in that category.

To proceed, we need to find the correct category ID for PS4 accessories. Since there isn't a direct tool for listing categories, we might need to explore other tools or methods to identify the correct category ID.

Let's try using the `search_products_by_name_admin` tool to search for products with "PS4" in their name, which might help us identify the correct category ID through the product details.

I'll proceed to get the documentation for the `search_products_by_name_admin` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:

Step 13:

THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name_admin` tool allows us to search for products using a name pattern with SQL LIKE syntax. We can use this tool to search for products with "PS4" in their name, which might help us identify the correct category ID through the product details.

Let's proceed to call this function with the name pattern "%PS4%" to find relevant products.

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search results have returned a list of products with "PS4" in their name. This list includes product names, SKUs, and prices. We can use this information to identify products related to PS4 accessories.

Since the response was truncated, I'll retrieve the full response to ensure we have all the necessary details.
CODE:
full_response = get_response('response_3')
full_response_items = full_response['content']['items']
# Sort the items by price in ascending order
sorted_items = sorted(full_response_items, key=lambda x: x['price'])

      2 full_response_items = full_response['content']['items']
      3 # Sort the items by price in ascending order

NameError: name 'get_response' is not defined

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error due to the environment not recognizing the `get_response` function. Let's try retrieving the full response again to sort the products by price.

I'll attempt to retrieve the full response and sort the products by price in ascending order.
CODE:
from utils import get_response

# Retrieve the full response for the search results
full_response = get_response('response_3')
full_response_items = full_response['content']['items']

# Sort the items by price in ascending order
sorted_items = sorted(full_response_items, key=lambda x: x['price'])
sorted_items

      7 # Sort the items by price in ascending order
      8 sorted_items = sorted(full_response_items, key=lambda x: x['price'])

KeyError: 'content'

Step 16:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue accessing the 'content' key in the response. Let's retrieve the full response again and inspect its structure to ensure we access the correct data.

I'll retrieve the full response and print it to understand its structure.
CODE:
# Retrieve the full response for the search results
full_response = get_response('response_3')
print(full_response)
