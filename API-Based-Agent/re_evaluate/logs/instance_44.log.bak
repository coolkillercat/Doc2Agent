Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Check out my todos***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in a specific category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
# Then, get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
# Finally, call the function with appropriate parameters
call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id='183', commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 1:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: An error occurred while processing your request. Please try again.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 2:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 3:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: An error occurred while processing your request. Please try again.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 4:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To check out your todos on GitLab, I'll follow the API workflow to interact with the GitLab API. Let's start by listing the available tools in the 'todos' category.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='todos')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'
DEBUG: Looking for GitLab subdirectory tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/todos/tool_description.json
DEBUG: File exists: True
DEBUG: Successfully read tool_description.json for todos
"Available tools in GitLab todos:\n- get_todo_items: Retrieves a user's to-do items from GitLab with optional filtering by state, action type, and target object type.\n- get_todos: Retrieves to-do items for the current user with optional filtering options to narrow down results by action, author, project, group, state or type of to-do item.\n- mark_todo_as_done: Marks a specific to-do item as completed based on its ID.\n- mark_all_todos_as_done: Marks all pending to-do items for the current user as done."

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Now that we have the list of available tools in the 'todos' category, I'll check the documentation for the `get_todos` tool to understand how to retrieve your to-do items.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('get_todos', site='gitlab', category='todos')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/todos/get_todos.py
'"""\nRetrieves to-do items for the current user with optional filtering options to narrow down results by action, author, project, group, state or type of to-do item.\n    \n    Args:\n        action (str, optional): The action to be filtered. Can be \'assigned\', \'mentioned\', \'build_failed\', etc.\n        author_id (int, optional): The ID of an author.\n        project_id (int, optional): The ID of a project.\n        group_id (int, optional): The ID of a group.\n        state (str, optional): The state of the to-do item. Can be either \'pending\' or \'done\'.\n        type (str, optional): The type of to-do item. Can be \'Issue\', \'MergeRequest\', \'Commit\', etc.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of to-do items for the current user with details about each item including project information, author, action type, target, and status.\n""" example: get_todos(project_id=183, state=\'pending\')'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_todos` tool allows us to retrieve to-do items for the current user with various optional filters. Since the task is to check out your todos, I'll call the `get_todos` function without any filters to get all your to-do items.

Let's proceed with calling the function to retrieve your to-do items.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
todos = call_function('get_todos', site='gitlab', category='todos')
print(todos)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: get_todos
site: gitlab
category: todos
parameter: 
url: http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/todos
status_code: 200
content: []

[Response stored as 'response_1' - use get_response('response_1', 'search_term') to search within it]
{'status_code': 200, 'content': [], 'url': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/todos', '_truncated_response_id': 'response_1', '_original_response': <Response [200]>}


Step 8:
act - AgentFinishAction(outputs={}, thought='The response indicates that there are no to-do items for the current user, as the content is an empty list. Therefore, you currently have no pending or completed to-dos on GitLab.\n\nFinish[You have no to-do items on GitLab.]', action='finish')
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')
