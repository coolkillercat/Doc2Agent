CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Set my gitlab status as Playing Badminton.***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To set your GitLab status as "Playing Badminton," we need to interact with the GitLab API. Let's follow the steps to achieve this:

1. First, we need to list the available tools in the "users" category to find the appropriate tool for setting the user status.
2. Then, we'll check the documentation for the relevant tool to understand the required parameters.
3. Finally, we'll call the function to set the status.

Let's start by listing the tools in the "users" category.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
# List available tools in the 'users' category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'
DEBUG: Looking for GitLab subdirectory tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/tool_description.json
DEBUG: File exists: True
DEBUG: Successfully read tool_description.json for users

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool we need to use is `set_user_status`, which is designed to set the status of a GitLab user. Let's proceed by checking the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
# Get documentation for the 'set_user_status' tool
get_documentation('set_user_status', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/set_user_status.py
'"""\nSets or updates the current user\'s status with custom emoji, message, and optional auto-clear timing. Allows choosing between PUT (replace entire status) or PATCH (update only specified fields).\n\n    Args:\n        emoji (str): Name of the emoji to use as status. Default is \'speech_balloon\'.\n        message (str): Message to set as a status. Cannot exceed 100 characters.\n        clear_status_after (str): When to automatically clear status. Allowed values: \n            \'30_minutes\', \'3_hours\', \'8_hours\', \'1_day\', \'3_days\', \'7_days\', \'30_days\'\n        method (str): HTTP method to use, either \'PUT\' (replace all fields) or \'PATCH\' (update only specified fields)\n\n    Returns:\n        Returns the user\'s status information including emoji, message, availability, HTML-formatted message, and auto-clear timestamp.\n""" example: set_user_status(emoji=\'coffee\', message=\'I need more coffee\', clear_status_after=\'3_hours\', method=\'PUT\')'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `set_user_status` tool allows us to set or update the current user's status with a custom message and optional emoji. We can also specify when the status should automatically clear. The parameters we need to provide are:

- `emoji`: The name of the emoji to use as status (default is 'speech_balloon').
- `message`: The message to set as a status (cannot exceed 100 characters).
- `clear_status_after`: When to automatically clear the status (optional).
- `method`: HTTP method to use, either 'PUT' (replace all fields) or 'PATCH' (update only specified fields).

Now, let's call the function to set your GitLab status to "Playing Badminton" using the default emoji and without specifying a clear status time.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Set the GitLab status to "Playing Badminton"
response = call_function('set_user_status', site='gitlab', category='users',
                         message='Playing Badminton', method='PUT')
response

 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_1',
 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 8:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The GitLab status has been successfully set to "Playing Badminton" with the default emoji "speech_balloon". The status update was successful, as indicated by the status code 200.

Finish[Playing Badminton]
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 9:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 10:
act - AgentFinishAction(outputs={}, thought='Finish[Playing Badminton]  <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>', action='finish')
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')
