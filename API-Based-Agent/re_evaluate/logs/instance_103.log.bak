CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Display the list of issues in the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository that have labels related to questions***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in a specific category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
# Then, get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
# Finally, call the function with appropriate parameters
call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id='183', commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

I saw that converters are meant for non-default constructible types, but [this example in the documentation](https://arduinojson.org/v6/error/invalid-initialization-of-reference-of-to-string/#how-to-support-non-default-constructible-types) gave the impression that it also should work for default-constructible types and I had a preference over putting this logic in separate converter classes rather than having them floating around in the (global) namespace as the `convertFromJson` / `canConvertFromJson` / `convertToJson` methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen writing a custom converter class I get compiler errors (listed below) that refer me to https://arduinojson.org/v6/error/no-matching-function-for-call-to-canconvertfromjson/, but there is just written that there are 2 options:\\r\\n1. write the `convertFromJson` / `canConvertFromJson` / `convertToJson` methods --> this works\\r\\n2. write a custom converter --> this I tried, and somehow it is not found\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should I do to make ArduinoJson find my custom converter class? Or should I not use it?\\r\\n\\r\\n> NOTE: Most custom converter documentation pages say that one should use `VariantConstRef` but looking at `ConverterImpl.hpp` it seems that that should be `JsonVariantConst`.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Troubleshooter report**  \\r\\nHere is the report generated by the [ArduinoJson Troubleshooter](https://arduinojson.org/v6/troubleshooter/):  \\r\\n[Paste the report here]\\r\\n\\r\\n**Environment**  \\r\\nHere is the environment that I\\\'m using\\\':\\r\\n* Microcontroller: ESP32\\r\\n* Core/runtime: ESP32 core for Arduino `framework-arduinoespressif32` `3.20006.221224`\\r\\n* IDE: PlatformIO in VS Code\\r\\n\\r\\n**Reproduction**  \\r\\nCreate a file called `DeviceAuthorizationResponse.h`:\\r\\n```c++\\r\\n#include <ArduinoJson.h>\\r\\n\\r\\nclass DeviceAuthorizationResponse\\r\\n{\\r\\npublic:\\r\\n    DeviceAuthorizationResponse() {}\\r\\n    ~DeviceAuthorizationResponse() {}\\r\\n    const char *device_code;\\r\\n    const char *user_code;\\r\\n    const char *verification_uri;\\r\\n    int expires_in;\\r\\n    int interval;\\r\\n};\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing this conversion logic works.

1. **Title:** Parsing yaml, I need to store JsonObject pointers in std::queue, is this possible?
   - **Description:** I'm trying to create an ArduinoJson document from a yaml file. I tried using YamlDuino which looked very promising but deserializing a yaml file of 10k will take over 140K of heap memory, which I don't have available, so I am looking for an alternative.

Step 20:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
