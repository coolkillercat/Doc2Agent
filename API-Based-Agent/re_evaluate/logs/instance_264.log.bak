Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***I want to browse the products in the Cabinets, Racks & Shelves category***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:

CONTENT: To browse products in the "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" category, I will use the `search_products_by_category_admin` tool. First, I need to check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it properly.

Let's get the documentation for the `search_products_by_category_admin` tool.

Step 8:

THOUGHT: Let's proceed by retrieving the documentation for the `search_products_by_category_admin` tool to understand how to use it for browsing products in the "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" category.

Step 9:

THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_category_admin` tool requires a `category_id` to find products in a specific category. It also supports optional parameters like `page_size`, `current_page`, `sort_by`, and `sort_direction`.

To proceed, I need to know the `category_id` for "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves". If this information is not directly available, I might need to search for it using another tool or assume a common ID if known.

Let's assume I have the `category_id` for "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" as `123` (this is a placeholder, and in a real scenario, you would retrieve this from a category listing or similar tool). Now, I'll call the function to search for products in this category.
CODE:

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an internal error when trying to retrieve products from the "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" category. This could be due to an incorrect `category_id` or an issue with the server.

To proceed, I need to verify the correct `category_id` for "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves". If the category ID is unknown, I might need to use another tool to list categories and find the correct ID.
