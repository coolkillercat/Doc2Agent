Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Presents the monthly count of successful orders from May to December 2022 in MM:COUNT format***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To accomplish the task of presenting the monthly count of successful orders from May to December 2022 in MM:COUNT format, I'll follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the `shopping_admin` site to identify the appropriate API for retrieving order data.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool to understand the required parameters and response structure.
3. Call the API to retrieve order data for each month from May to December 2022.
4. Analyze the response to count the successful orders for each month.
5. Format the results in the required MM:COUNT format.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the `shopping_admin` site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool `list_orders_GET` seems to be the most relevant for retrieving orders based on specified search criteria. Let's proceed by checking the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it to filter orders by date and status.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('list_orders_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_orders_GET` tool allows us to filter orders by specific fields such as `status` and `created_at`. We can use this tool to retrieve orders for each month from May to December 2022 and filter them by the status "complete" to count successful orders.

Let's proceed by calling the API for each month and counting the successful orders. I'll start with May 2022.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Define a function to get the count of successful orders for a given month
def get_successful_orders_count(year, month):
    # Format the month to ensure two digits
    month_str = f"{month:02}"
    # Define the date range for the month
    start_date = f"{year}-{month_str}-01"
    end_date = f"{year}-{month_str}-31"
    
    # Call the API to get orders for the specified month with status 'complete'
    response = call_function(
        'list_orders_GET',
        site='shopping_admin',
        searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_field='created_at',
        searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_value=f"{year}-{month_str}",
        searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_conditionType='like',
        searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_field='status',
        searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_value='complete',

        searchCriteria_currentPage=1
    )
    
    # Return the count of successful orders
    return len(response.get('content', {}).get('items', []))

# Get the count of successful orders for May 2022
may_count = get_successful_orders_count(2022, 5)

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error in handling the response from the `call_function`. The response might be a string instead of a dictionary. Let's print the response to understand its structure and then proceed accordingly.

I'll modify the code to print the response for May 2022.
CODE:
# Call the API to get orders for May 2022 with status 'complete'
response = call_function(

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The error indicates that the `list_orders_GET` function does not accept the parameter `searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_field`. It seems we need to adjust the parameters to fit the expected input for this function.

Let's simplify the search criteria to focus on filtering by `created_at` and `status` using a single filter group. I'll attempt to retrieve the orders for May 2022 again with the corrected parameters.
CODE:
# Attempt to retrieve orders for May 2022 with corrected parameters
response = call_function(

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the `list_orders_GET` function does not support multiple filters in the way I attempted. Let's try using a single filter group with a combined condition for both `created_at` and `status`. I'll attempt to retrieve the orders for May 2022 again with a different approach.

I'll use a single filter group and adjust the parameters accordingly.
CODE:

response = call_function(
    'list_orders_GET',
    site='shopping_admin',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_field='created_at',

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the `list_orders_GET` function does not support multiple filters within a single filter group as I attempted. Let's try using a different approach by focusing on one filter at a time and then combining the results programmatically.

I'll start by retrieving orders for May 2022 filtered by `created_at` and then filter the results by `status` programmatically.
CODE:

Step 12:

THOUGHT: The response indicates that there are no orders for May 2022 with the current filter. It seems there might be an issue with the data or the filtering criteria. Let's try to retrieve orders for a different month to verify if the issue persists.

I'll attempt to retrieve orders for June 2022 using the same approach.

# Retrieve orders for June 2022 filtered by 'created_at'
response_june = call_function(

THOUGHT: It appears that there are no orders for both May and June 2022 with the current filter. This might indicate an issue with the data availability or the filtering criteria. To ensure that the filtering criteria are correct, let's try a different approach by checking for any orders in a broader date range and then filtering by status programmatically.

I'll attempt to retrieve orders for the entire year of 2022 and then filter them by month and status.
CODE:
# Retrieve orders for the entire year of 2022 filtered by 'created_at'
response_year = call_function(
    'list_orders_GET',
    site='shopping_admin',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_field='created_at',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_value='2022',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_conditionType='like',
    searchCriteria_pageSize=100,
    searchCriteria_currentPage=1
)

# Print the response to understand its structure
print(response_year)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

        "filters": [
          {

            "value": "2022",
            "condition_type": "like"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "page_size": 100,
    "current_page": 1

  "total_count": 0

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that there are no orders available for the entire year of 2022 with the current filter. This might indicate an issue with the data availability or the filtering criteria. Since the API is returning no orders, it is possible that the data for 2022 is not present or the filtering criteria need adjustment.

Given the current situation, I will attempt to retrieve orders without any date filter to check if there are any orders available at all. This will help us understand if the issue is with the data or the filtering criteria.

Let's proceed by retrieving orders without any date filter.
CODE:
# Retrieve orders without any date filter
response_no_filter = call_function(
    'list_orders_GET',
    site='shopping_admin',
    searchCriteria_pageSize=100,
    searchCriteria_currentPage=1
)

# Print the response to understand its structure
print(response_no_filter)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: list_orders_GET
site: shopping_admin
parameter: searchCriteria_pageSize=100, searchCriteria_currentPage=1


Step 15:
act - AgentFinishAction(outputs={}, thought='', action='finish')
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')
