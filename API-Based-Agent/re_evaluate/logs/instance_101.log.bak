Step 4:

THOUGHT: To find the nearest In-N-Out to Upitts and determine the walking distance, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the map site to see what functionalities are available.
2. Check the documentation for relevant tools that can help find locations and calculate distances.
3. Use the appropriate API calls to find the nearest In-N-Out and calculate the walking distance.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the map site.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the nearest In-N-Out to Upitts and determine the walking distance, I will use the following approach:

1. Use the `search_GET` tool to find the location of Upitts.
2. Use the `nearest_service_GET` tool to find the nearest In-N-Out location.
3. Use the `route_service_GET` tool to calculate the walking distance between Upitts and the nearest In-N-Out.

Let's start by checking the documentation for the `search_GET` tool to find the location of Upitts.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_GET` tool allows us to search for locations using a free-form query or structured query parameters. We can use this tool to find the location of Upitts by providing a query string.

Let's proceed to find the location of Upitts using the `search_GET` tool with a free-form query.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for the location of Upitts
upitts_location = call_function('search_GET', site='map', q='University of Pittsburgh', format='json', limit=1, addressdetails=1)

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have successfully obtained the location of the University of Pittsburgh (Upitts) with the following coordinates:
- Latitude: 40.4441530
- Longitude: -79.9624610

Next, we need to find the nearest In-N-Out location using the `nearest_service_GET` tool. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool is used to find the nearest street segments to a given coordinate. However, it seems more suitable for finding street segments rather than specific places like In-N-Out.

Instead, we should use the `search_GET` tool again to find the nearest In-N-Out location by searching for "In-N-Out" near the coordinates of Upitts. Let's proceed with that approach.
CODE:
