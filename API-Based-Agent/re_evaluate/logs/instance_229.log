Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***What is the price range for products from ugreen?***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To determine the price range for products from "ugreen," I'll follow the API workflow:

1. List available tools to find the appropriate one for searching products.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool to understand how to use it.
3. Call the function to search for products from "ugreen" and analyze the price range.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

list_tools(site='shopping')

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the price range for products from "ugreen," the most relevant tool seems to be `search_products_by_name_admin`, which allows searching for products by name. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_name_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_products_by_name_admin.py
'"""\nSearches for products whose names match a specific pattern using SQL LIKE syntax.\n    \n    Args:\n        name_pattern (str): The pattern to search for in product names (SQL LIKE syntax, % is used as wildcard)\n        page_size (int, optional): Maximum number of items to return\n        current_page (int, optional): Current page of results\n        sort_by (str, optional): Field to sort by\n        sort_direction (str, optional): Sort direction, \'ASC\' or \'DESC\'\n        return_fields (list, optional): List of fields to return in the response\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of products with their SKUs, names, and prices that match the specified search pattern.\n""" example: search_products_by_name("%Tee%", page_size=10, sort_by="name", sort_direction="ASC", return_fields=["name", "sku", "price"])'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name_admin` tool allows us to search for products using a name pattern with SQL LIKE syntax. We can use `%ugreen%` as the pattern to find products from "ugreen." We can also specify the fields we want to return, such as the product name, SKU, and price.

Let's proceed to call this function to search for "ugreen" products and determine their price range.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for products with "ugreen" in their name
result = call_function(
    'search_products_by_name_admin',
    site='shopping',
    name_pattern='%ugreen%',
    return_fields=['name', 'price']
