CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to wikipedia and map. Answer the question: ***Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Yankees in the 80th***
The site URL for wikipedia is http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8888, use this instead of the normal wikipedia URL. 
The site URL for map is http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000, use this instead of the normal map URL. 

For the map website, you will be provided with three sets of APIs, each providing different functionalities; 
For the wikipedia website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. get_documentation(tool_name, site='wikipedia') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
2. call_function(tool_name, site='wikipedia', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
3. call_direct(method, url, headers, body, site='wikipedia') - For custom API calls

**AVAILABLE TOOLS:**
Available tools:
- get_available_categories: Retrieves the list of all content categories available in the ZIM file library as an OPDS Navigation Feed
- get_available_languages: Retrieves the list of all languages available in the ZIM file library as an OPDS Navigation Feed
- get_catalog_root: Retrieves the OPDS Catalog Root that links to all OPDS acquisition and navigation feeds available through the API
- get_content: Retrieves specific content from a ZIM file, with optional path parameter (empty path returns main page)
- get_entry_details: Retrieves full metadata information about a specific ZIM file identified by its UUID
- get_entry_illustration: Retrieves the illustration/cover image of specified size for a ZIM file identified by its UUID
- get_library_entries: Retrieves a complete list or filtered subset of ZIM files in the library as a paginated OPDS acquisition feed
- get_metadata: Retrieves a specific metadata item from a ZIM file, providing access to embedded metadata information
- get_partial_library_entries: Retrieves a list of ZIM files with partial entry information, useful for displaying compact library listings
- get_random_article: Retrieves a randomly selected article from the specified ZIM file, useful for exploration features
- get_raw_content: Retrieves raw content from a ZIM file without any server-side processing, ensuring original data is preserved
- get_suggestions: Retrieves title suggestions for partially typed search queries against a specific ZIM file, supporting autocomplete functionality
- search_geospatial: Performs a geospatial search to find content within a specified distance of geographical coordinates
- search_library: Performs a full text search across specified ZIM files and returns results with snippets of matching content

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import get_documentation, call_function
# Get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('search_library', site='wikipedia')
# Call the function with search parameters
results = call_function('search_library', site='wikipedia', pattern='artificial intelligence')
</execute_ipython>
