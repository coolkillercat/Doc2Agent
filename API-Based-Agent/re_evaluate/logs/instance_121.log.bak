CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Tell me the reasons why customers like Circe hooded fleece***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

THOUGHT: To find out why customers like the "Circe hooded fleece," we need to gather customer feedback or reviews related to this product. Based on the available tools, we should look for tools that can help us retrieve product reviews or customer comments.

The tool `search_products_by_name` seems relevant for finding the product, and then we might need to look for customer reviews or comments related to it. Let's start by checking the documentation for `search_products_by_name` to understand how we can use it to find the "Circe hooded fleece."
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_name.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name` tool allows us to search for products using a name pattern with SQL LIKE syntax. We can use this tool to find the "Circe hooded fleece" by searching for a pattern that matches its name.

Let's proceed by calling the `search_products_by_name` function to find the product details for "Circe hooded fleece." We'll use a pattern like `%Circe hooded fleece%` to ensure we capture the product accurately.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Search for the product "Circe hooded fleece"
response = call_function('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin',
                         name_pattern='%Circe hooded fleece%',

Step 8:

THOUGHT: It seems that the search for the "Circe hooded fleece" did not return any results, as the `items` field is `null`. This could mean that the product name might be slightly different, or it might not be available in the current catalog.

To proceed, let's try a broader search using a more general pattern like `%Circe%` to see if we can find any related products. This might help us identify the correct product name or any variations that exist.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have successfully found the product "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" and its variants. Now, to understand why customers like this product, we need to gather customer feedback or reviews. 

Let's look for a tool that can help us retrieve customer reviews or comments related to this product. Based on the available tools, we should check if there is a tool for retrieving product reviews or customer feedback.

I'll search for any tools related to customer reviews or comments:
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
# Check documentation for any tool related to customer reviews or comments
get_documentation('list_comments_for_order_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/list_comments_for_order_GET.py
'"""\nLists comments for a specified order.\n    \n    Args:\n        id (int): The order ID. Required.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of comments for a specified order including the comment text, creation date, and visibility settings.\n    Example:\n        >>> response = list_comments_for_order(id=123)\n        >>> print(response.status_code)\n        200\n""" example: list_comments_for_order(id=123)'

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool retrieves comments for a specified order, but it doesn't seem directly related to product reviews or customer feedback on products. Since we are looking for reasons why customers like the "Circe hooded fleece," we need to find a tool that can provide product reviews or customer feedback.

Let's try searching for any tools related to product reviews or customer feedback in the list of available tools. I'll look for any tool that might help us gather customer opinions or reviews about products.
CODE:
# Check for any tools related to product reviews or customer feedback
get_documentation('search_products_by_keyword', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_keyword.py

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_keyword` tool is designed to search for products using a specific keyword, but it doesn't directly provide customer reviews or feedback.

Since we haven't found a tool specifically for retrieving product reviews or customer feedback, let's try a different approach. We can search for customer orders that include the "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" and then look for any comments or feedback associated with those orders.

I'll proceed by searching for orders that include the "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" using the `search_orders` tool, which allows us to search for orders based on specified criteria. Let's check the documentation for `search_orders` to see how we can use it to find relevant orders.
CODE:

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders` tool allows us to search for orders based on specified criteria. We can use this tool to find orders that include the "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" by searching for the product SKU in the order items.

Let's proceed by calling the `search_orders` function to find orders that include the product with SKU "WH12" (the SKU for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece"). We'll search for orders where the product SKU matches "WH12" and then look for any comments or feedback associated with those orders.
CODE:
# Search for orders that include the product with SKU "WH12"
orders_response = call_function('search_orders', site='shopping_admin',
                                field='items.sku',
