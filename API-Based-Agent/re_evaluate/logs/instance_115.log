Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Show me the name of the customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with Chloe tank***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the names of customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with the "Chloe tank," we need to identify tools related to customer feedback or reviews. Let's start by checking the documentation for tools that might help us search for customer feedback or reviews.

I'll look for tools related to customer feedback or reviews in the list of available tools. Let's start by checking the documentation for the `search_customers_GET` tool, as it might help us find customers based on specific criteria.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_customers_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_customers_GET.py
'"""\nSearch for customers based on specified criteria.\n    \n    Args:\n        field (str): The field to filter by (e.g., \'email\', \'firstname\', \'lastname\')\n        value (str): The value to filter for\n        condition_type (str): The condition type for filtering (e.g., \'eq\', \'like\', \'gt\')\n        sort_field (str): Field to sort results by (e.g., \'created_at\', \'email\')\n        sort_direction (str): Direction to sort (\'ASC\' or \'DESC\')\n        page_size (int): Number of results per page\n        current_page (int): Current page number\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns customer records matching specified search criteria with their personal information, addresses, and account details.\n    Example:\n        >>> search_customers(field=\'email\', value=\'example@example.com\')\n        >>> search_customers(field=\'firstname\', value=\'John\', sort_field=\'created_at\', sort_direction=\'DESC\')\n""" example: search_customers(field=\'email\', value=\'emma.lopez@gmail.com\', sort_field=\'created_at\', sort_direction=\'ASC\')'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_customers_GET` tool allows us to search for customers based on specified criteria such as email, firstname, or lastname. However, it doesn't directly relate to customer feedback or reviews.

To find customer dissatisfaction, we need to look for tools related to customer feedback or reviews. Let's check the documentation for the `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool, as it might provide insights into customer comments or feedback related to orders.
CODE:
get_documentation('list_comments_for_order_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/list_comments_for_order_GET.py

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool allows us to list comments for a specified order, which can include customer feedback or dissatisfaction. However, we need to know the order IDs related to the "Chloe tank" to use this tool effectively.

To proceed, we should:
1. Search for orders containing the "Chloe tank."
2. Use the order IDs to retrieve comments and identify any dissatisfaction.

Let's start by searching for orders that include the "Chloe tank." I'll check the documentation for the `search_orders` tool to see if it can help us find orders based on product names or SKUs.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_orders', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_orders.py
'"""\nSearches for orders based on specified criteria, with support for pagination, sorting, and field selection.\n    \n    Args:\n        field (str): The field to search on\n        value (str): The value to search for\n        condition_type (str, optional): The condition type for filtering. Defaults to \'eq\'.\n        page_size (int, optional): Maximum number of items to return. Defaults to None.\n        current_page (int, optional): Current page number.

Defaults to \'DESC\'.\n        return_fields (list, optional): List of fields to return in the response. Defaults to None.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns order search results matching specified criteria, including order IDs and other order details.\n""" example: search_orders(\nfield="status",\nvalue="pending",\npage_size=10,\nsort_by="created_at",\nreturn_fields=["increment_id", "entity_id"]\n)'

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders` tool allows us to search for orders based on specified criteria, including fields like status, with support for pagination, sorting, and field selection. However, it doesn't directly mention searching by product name or SKU.

To find orders containing the "Chloe tank," we might need to use a combination of tools. Let's check the documentation for the `search_products_by_name` tool to see if it can help us identify the SKU or other identifiers for the "Chloe tank."
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_name.py
'"""\nSearches for products whose names match a specific pattern using SQL LIKE syntax.\n    \n    Args:\n        name_pattern (str): The pattern to search for in product names (SQL LIKE syntax, % is used as wildcard)\n        page_size (int, optional): Maximum number of items to return\n        current_page (int, optional): Current page of results\n        sort_by (str, optional): Field to sort by\n        sort_direction (str, optional): Sort direction, \'ASC\' or \'DESC\'\n        return_fields (list, optional): List of fields to return in the response\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of products with their SKUs, names, and prices that match the specified name pattern search criteria.\n""" example: search_products_by_name("%Tee%", page_size=10, sort_by="name", sort_direction="ASC", return_fields=["name", "sku", "price"])'

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name` tool allows us to search for products whose names match a specific pattern using SQL LIKE syntax. This will help us find the "Chloe tank" and retrieve its SKU or other identifiers.

Let's search for the "Chloe tank" to get its SKU, which we can then use to find related orders.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Search for the "Chloe tank" product to get its SKU
response = call_function('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin',
                         name_pattern='%Chloe tank%',
                         return_fields=['name', 'sku'])

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search for the "Chloe tank" did not return any results, as the `items` field is `null`. This could mean that the product name might be slightly different or not available in the current dataset.

To proceed, let's try a broader search using a wildcard pattern to see if we can find any products related to "Chloe" that might include the "Chloe tank." I'll adjust the search pattern to be more inclusive.
CODE:
# Broaden the search pattern to include any product with "Chloe" in the name
response = call_function('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin',
                         name_pattern='%Chloe%',

THOUGHT: It seems that there was an internal error when attempting to search for orders with the specified SKU. This might be due to an issue with the API or the specific query parameters.

To proceed, let's try a different approach by using the `search_orders_with_multiple_conditions` tool, which might offer more flexibility in constructing the query. I'll check the documentation for this tool to see how we can use it to search for orders containing the "Chloe Compete Tank."
CODE:
get_documentation('search_orders_with_multiple_conditions', site='shopping_admin')

THOUGHT: The `search_orders_with_multiple_conditions` tool allows us to search for orders using multiple filter conditions with logical AND between condition groups and logical OR within each group. This tool provides flexibility in constructing complex queries.

Let's use this tool to search for orders containing the "Chloe Compete Tank" by specifying multiple SKUs in the filter conditions. I'll construct a query to search for orders with SKUs related to the "Chloe Compete Tank."
CODE:
# Construct filter conditions for multiple SKUs related to "Chloe Compete Tank"
filter_conditions = [
    {
        'filters': [

Step 15:

THOUGHT: It seems that we're encountering internal errors when trying to search for orders using the specified SKUs. This might be due to the complexity of the query or an issue with the API.

As an alternative approach, let's try using the `search_orders` tool with a simpler query to see if we can retrieve any orders containing the "Chloe Compete Tank" by using a broader SKU pattern. I'll attempt to search for orders with SKUs starting with "WT06" to capture all variations of the "Chloe Compete Tank."

Step 16:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: It seems that we're consistently encountering internal errors when attempting to search for orders using the SKU. This suggests there might be an issue with the API or the specific query parameters being used.

Given the constraints and the errors encountered, it might be challenging to retrieve the necessary order data directly through the current API setup. However, if we had access to a tool that could directly search for customer feedback or comments related to specific products, that would be ideal.

Since the current approach is not yielding results due to internal errors, and considering the limited number of attempts left, it might be best to conclude that the task cannot be completed with the current API setup due to these technical issues.

If you have any other specific requests or need further assistance, please let me know!

Step 18:

THOUGHT: Given the constraints and the errors encountered, let's try a different approach by focusing on retrieving customer comments directly. We can attempt to use the `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool to see if we can access any comments related to orders, which might include feedback on the "Chloe tank."

Since we don't have specific order IDs due to the previous errors, let's try retrieving comments for a sample order ID to see if we can find any relevant feedback. I'll proceed with this approach.
CODE:
# Attempt to retrieve comments for a sample order ID
response = call_function('list_comments_for_order_GET', site='shopping_admin', id=1001)

            "condition_type": "eq"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "total_count": 0
}

[Response stored as 'response_6' - use get_response('response_6', 'search_term') to search within it]
{'status_code': 200,
 'content': {'items': [],
  'search_criteria': {'filter_groups': [{'filters': [{'field': 'parent_id',

 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_6',
 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 19:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The attempt to retrieve comments for the sample order ID 1001 returned no comments, as indicated by the `total_count` of 0. This suggests that either there are no comments for this order, or the order ID does not correspond to an order with comments.

Given the constraints and the errors encountered, it seems challenging to retrieve the necessary data directly through the current API setup. The internal errors and lack of comments for the sample order ID suggest that there might be limitations or issues with the API or the data available.

Since we have limited attempts left and the current approach is not yielding results, it might be best to conclude that the task cannot be completed with the current API setup due to these technical issues.

Step 21:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Given the constraints and the errors encountered, let's try a final approach by focusing on retrieving customer feedback directly. We can attempt to use the `search_customers_GET` tool to see if we can access any customer records that might include feedback or comments related to dissatisfaction.

Since we don't have specific feedback data due to the previous errors, let's try retrieving customer records with a broader search to see if we can find any relevant feedback. I'll proceed with this approach.
CODE:
# Attempt to search for customers with a broad search to find any relevant feedback
response = call_function('search_customers_GET', site='shopping_admin',
                         field='firstname',

Step 22:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: It seems that the search for customers with the name pattern "Chloe" did not return any results, as the `items` field is empty and the `total_count` is 0. This suggests that there might not be any customers with the name "Chloe" in the current dataset.

Given the constraints and the errors encountered, it appears that the task cannot be completed with the current API setup due to these technical issues and the lack of relevant data.
