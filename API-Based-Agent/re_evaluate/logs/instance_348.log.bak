Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***How many reviews our shop received in May 2023?***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find out how many reviews the shop received in May 2023, I need to identify the appropriate tool for retrieving review data. From the list of available tools, it seems that there isn't a direct tool named specifically for reviews. However, I will look for tools related to reviews or feedback.

I'll start by checking the documentation for any tool that might be related to reviews or feedback. Let's see if there's a tool that can help us retrieve review data.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_reviews_by_date_range', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_reviews_by_date_range.py
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_reviews_by_date_range.py
"No module found for tool 'search_reviews_by_date_range' in site 'shopping_admin'"

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there isn't a tool named `search_reviews_by_date_range` available in the `shopping_admin` site. I'll need to explore other tools that might help in retrieving review data.

Since the tool list is extensive, I'll search for any tool that might be related to reviews or feedback. Let's try checking the documentation for a tool that might be related to reviews or comments, such as `list_comments_for_order_GET`, to see if it can be used to retrieve review data.
CODE:
get_documentation('list_comments_for_order_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/list_comments_for_order_GET.py
'"""\nLists comments for a specified order.\n    \n    Args:\n        id (int): The order ID. Required.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of comments for a specified order including the comment text, creation date, and visibility settings.\n    Example:\n        >>> response = list_comments_for_order(id=123)\n        >>> print(response.status_code)\n        200\n""" example: list_comments_for_order(id=123)'

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool is designed to list comments for a specified order, which may not directly relate to retrieving reviews for the entire shop. Since this tool focuses on order-specific comments, it might not be suitable for gathering overall shop reviews.

Given the available tools, it seems there isn't a direct tool for retrieving shop-wide reviews. However, I will attempt to find any other tool that might be related to reviews or feedback by searching for keywords like "review" or "feedback" in the tool list.

Let's search for any tool that might be related to reviews or feedback.
CODE:
# Searching for tools related to reviews or feedback
tools_related_to_reviews = [tool for tool in list_tools(site='shopping_admin') if 'review' in tool or 'feedback' in tool]

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that there are no tools specifically related to reviews or feedback in the `shopping_admin` site. Since the direct approach to find reviews is not available, I will explore the possibility of using order-related tools to infer review data, if reviews are tied to orders.

I'll check the documentation for the `list_orders_GET` tool to see if it includes any information about reviews or feedback associated with orders.
CODE:
get_documentation('list_orders_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
