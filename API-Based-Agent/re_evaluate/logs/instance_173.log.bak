CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "better" in its title to check if it is closed***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in a specific category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
# Then, get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
# Finally, call the function with appropriate parameters
call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id='183', commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_issues` tool allows us to search issues with various filtering options, including searching by title. We can use the `search` parameter to find issues with the keyword "better" in their title and sort them by the `updated_at` field to get the latest updated issue.

Let's proceed by calling the `list_issues` function with the appropriate parameters to find the latest updated issue with "better" in its title.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Call the function to search for issues with "better" in the title, sorted by updated_at
issues = call_function(

If you scroll down a lot, you get to the readme eventually, but it\'s not especially friendly to make people do that (especially not people who have to use screen readers!).\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nTo help us try and reproduce the issue, please provide the following information:\r\n\r\n1. Laptop, but I doubt it matters.\r\n2. Windows 10, and I doubt it matters. \r\n3.

The idea being that if visually hidden content is focused, it might cause the screen to scroll and/or end up with a confusing tab order for a sighted keyboard-only user.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all screen reader users are totally blind keyboard-only users. I don\'t think it is safe to assume that screen reader users will never use a mouse, or active `:hover` styles.\r\n\r\nI was going to suggest that a better solution would be to apply a `tabindex="-1"` to visually hidden, but natively focusable content (such as an `<a>` or `<button>`), but I think the better solution is to display that content visually on hover, similar to the skip nav pattern.\r\n\r\nSo my proposed solution is to 1) remove the `:hover` css, and 2) describe how to implement the skip-nav-like pattern for visually hidden but natively focusable content.\r\n\r\nI\'d like a few people to weigh in before I submit a PR to fix this.', 'state': 'closed', 'created_at': '2017-07-20T21:48:46.000Z', 'updated_at': '2023-03-23T08:38:02.573Z', 'closed_at': None, 'closed_by': None, 'labels': [], 'milestone': None, 'assignees': [], 'author': {'id': 1, 'username': 'root', 'name': 'Administrator', 'state': 'active', 'avatar_url': 'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e64c7d89f26bd1972efa854d13d7dd61?s=80&d=identicon', 'web_url': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/root'}, 'type': 'ISSUE', 'assignee': None, 'user_notes_count': 2, 'merge_requests_count': 0, 'upvotes': 0, 'downvotes': 0, 'due_date': None, 'confidential': False, 'discussion_locked': None, 'issue_type': 'issue', 'web_url': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/-/issues/499', 'time_stats': {'time_estimate': 0, 'total_time_spent': 0, 'human_time_estimate': None, 'human_total_time_spent': None}, 'task_completion_status': {'count': 0, 'completed_count': 0}, 'has_tasks': False, '_links': {'self': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/174/issues/499', 'notes': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/174/issues/499/notes', 'award_emoji': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/174/issues/499/award_emoji', 'project': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/174', 'closed_as_duplicate_of': None}, 'references': {'short': '#499', 'relative': '#499', 'full': 'a11yproject/a11yproject.com#499'}, 'severity': 'UNKNOWN', 'moved_to_id': None, 'service_desk_reply_to': None}, {'id': 83202, 'iid': 314, 'project_id': 174, 'title': 'Edit on GitHub Button for Articles', 'description': '*Created by: grayghostvisuals*\n\nsee screenshot attached for a better understanding [http://cl.ly/image/0h3f2v2R1G1F](http://cl.ly/image/0h3f2v2R1G1F)\n', 'state': 'closed', 'created_at': '2015-02-13T17:21:08.000Z', 'updated_at': '2023-03-23T08:37:25.765Z', 'closed_at': None, 'closed_by': None, 'labels': ['enhancement', 'feature'], 'milestone': {'id': 584, 'iid': 2, 'project_id': 174, 'title': '2015 Design Refresh', 'description': "Our little website is 2 years old.

It leaves the impression that this is everything that is to do to make a website accessible.\n\nThe whole list oversimplifies accessibility issues, as it only shows a small bit of what accessible web design is about. It is not just a technical issue.\n\nSome of the tips may even be harmful, so is unobtrusive JavaScript a good sign for an accessible web site, but if you register a click event on a span for example it won’t be accessible by keyboard, no matter if you use inline JavaScript or unobtrusive techniques.\n\nIn the “Forms” section the site speaks about “logical layout” which isn’t testable and imprecise. The WCAG2 has very specific and testable criteria what a good form is and how it should work. To call that a “logical layout” may be okay for accessibility specialists (as they have the accessibility background), but says nothing to the beginner. \n\nThe title on the search field isn’t sufficient either. I’d recommend to use a hidden label and of course a role of search on the parent form. Speaking of roles: The ARIA roles come almost without any comments and should be better described. For example it should be clear what can be used once on a site and what’s better suited for multiple usage.\n\nYou recommend transcripts for audios, but not subtitles for videos.\n\nIn the color section I’d recommend a better description and talking about contrast more, especially underlining links and the importance of the :focus state.\n\nHaving a good document outline is also a must.\n\n“Test using a screen reader” isn’t really what people should do if they haven’t much knowledge of the inner workings. I know using ChromeVox can help understand what’s going on, but working with a real screen reader is too much, especially as they are highly configured for the needs of the individual person.\n\nI think it would really help to point out the grand scheme of things, mention content strategic topics (when we analyse sites, bad navigation structures are one of the major issues) and link to the relevant WCAG techniques.\n\nI hope this helps to improve the project. I will try to contribute some pull requests myself, but in general I’m opposed on the checklist thinking in terms of web accessibility.\n', 'state': 'closed', 'created_at': '2013-01-31T00:22:40.000Z', 'updated_at': '2023-03-23T08:36:44.107Z', 'closed_at': None, 'closed_by': None, 'labels': [], 'milestone': None, 'assignees': [], 'author': {'id': 1, 'username': 'root', 'name': 'Administrator', 'state': 'active', 'avatar_url': 'https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e64c7d89f26bd1972efa854d13d7dd61?s=80&d=identicon', 'web_url': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/root'}, 'type': 'ISSUE', 'assignee': None, 'user_notes_count': 6, 'merge_requests_count': 0, 'upvotes': 0, 'downvotes': 0, 'due_date': None, 'confidential': False, 'discussion_locked': None, 'issue_type': 'issue', 'web_url': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/-/issues/132', 'time_stats': {'time_estimate': 0, 'total_time_spent': 0, 'human_time_estimate': None, 'human_total_time_spent': None}, 'task_completion_status': {'count': 0, 'completed_count': 0}, 'has_tasks': False, '_links': {'self': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/174/issues/132', 'notes': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/174/issues/132/notes', 'award_emoji': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/174/issues/132/award_emoji', 'project': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/174', 'closed_as_duplicate_of': None}, 'references': {'short': '#132', 'relative': '#132', 'full': 'a11yproject/a11yproject.com#132'}, 'severity': 'UNKNOWN', 'moved_to_id': None, 'service_desk_reply_to': None}, {'id': 83034, 'iid': 111, 'project_id': 171, 'title': 'Request to join this organization', 'description': "*Created by: rutujak24*\n\nI am an undergraduate at PICT, Pune.
