CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to wikipedia and map. Answer the question: ***Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Philadelphia 76ers in the 70th***
The site URL for wikipedia is http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8888, use this instead of the normal wikipedia URL. 
The site URL for map is http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000, use this instead of the normal map URL. 

For the map website, you will be provided with three sets of APIs, each providing different functionalities; 
For the wikipedia website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. get_documentation(tool_name, site='wikipedia') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
2. call_function(tool_name, site='wikipedia', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
3. call_direct(method, url, headers, body, site='wikipedia') - For custom API calls

**AVAILABLE TOOLS:**
Available tools:
- get_available_categories: Retrieves the list of all content categories available in the ZIM file library as an OPDS Navigation Feed
- get_available_languages: Retrieves the list of all languages available in the ZIM file library as an OPDS Navigation Feed
- get_catalog_root: Retrieves the OPDS Catalog Root that links to all OPDS acquisition and navigation feeds available through the API
- get_content: Retrieves specific content from a ZIM file, with optional path parameter (empty path returns main page)
- get_entry_details: Retrieves full metadata information about a specific ZIM file identified by its UUID
- get_entry_illustration: Retrieves the illustration/cover image of specified size for a ZIM file identified by its UUID
- get_library_entries: Retrieves a complete list or filtered subset of ZIM files in the library as a paginated OPDS acquisition feed
- get_metadata: Retrieves a specific metadata item from a ZIM file, providing access to embedded metadata information
- get_partial_library_entries: Retrieves a list of ZIM files with partial entry information, useful for displaying compact library listings
- get_random_article: Retrieves a randomly selected article from the specified ZIM file, useful for exploration features
- get_raw_content: Retrieves raw content from a ZIM file without any server-side processing, ensuring original data is preserved
- get_suggestions: Retrieves title suggestions for partially typed search queries against a specific ZIM file, supporting autocomplete functionality
- search_geospatial: Performs a geospatial search to find content within a specified distance of geographical coordinates
- search_library: Performs a full text search across specified ZIM files and returns results with snippets of matching content

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import get_documentation, call_function
# Get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('search_library', site='wikipedia')
# Call the function with search parameters
results = call_function('search_library', site='wikipedia', pattern='artificial intelligence')
</execute_ipython>

Step 20:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The response from the refined search query was also truncated. Let's retrieve the full response to find the relevant information about the Philadelphia 76ers' stadium history.

I'll use the `get_response` function to access the full content and search for the necessary details.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 21:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 22:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Let's retrieve the full response to find the relevant information about the Philadelphia 76ers' stadium history.

I'll use the `get_response` function to access the full content and search for the necessary details.
CODE:
# Retrieve the full response for the refined search
full_refined_response = get_response('response_2')
# Search for the stadium history information
stadium_history_info = get_response('response_2', 'stadium history')
stadium_history_info
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 23:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: It seems that the search did not return specific information about the Philadelphia 76ers' stadium history. Let's try a different approach by searching for the "Philadelphia 76ers" and "The Spectrum" since The Spectrum was known to be their home stadium during the 1970s.

I'll perform another search with this refined query to find the relevant details.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 24:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.

Step 25:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Let's perform a search using the term "The Spectrum Philadelphia 76ers" to gather relevant details about their home stadium in the 1970s.

I'll execute this search now.
