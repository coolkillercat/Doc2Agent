Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Start a private project project_site with NodeJS template and add primer, convexegg, vinta as members***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To start a private project with a NodeJS template and add members, we need to follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the `project_templates` category to find a tool for creating a project with a template.
2. Use the appropriate tool to create a private project with the NodeJS template.
3. List available tools in the `members` category to find a tool for adding members to the project.
4. Use the appropriate tool to add the specified members to the project.

Let's start by listing the tools in the `project_templates` category to find the tool for creating a project with a template.
CODE:

'Available tools in GitLab project_templates:'

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue retrieving the list of available tools in the `project_templates` category. Let's try listing the tools again to ensure we have the correct information.

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is still an issue with retrieving the list of tools. Let's try listing tools in both the `projects` and `project_templates` categories to see if we can get any information from either category.

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_project` tool allows us to create a new GitLab project with various customizable settings. We need to create a private project with the NodeJS template. However, the documentation does not mention templates directly. We might need to create the project first and then apply the template.

Let's proceed to create a private project named `project_site` and initialize it with a README. After that, we will explore how to apply the NodeJS template.
CODE:

Step 11:

Step 18:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with the `invite_member` tool, as it requires either an email or user ID, but the error message suggests a problem with the request. Let's try using the `add_member_to_group_or_project` tool instead, which might be more appropriate for adding existing users to a project.

First, let's check the documentation for the `add_member_to_group_or_project` tool to understand how to use it.

Step 19:

THOUGHT: The `add_member_to_group_or_project` tool allows us to add a user as a member to a project with a specified access level. Let's use this tool to add the users `primer`, `convexegg`, and `vinta` to the project `project_site`.

We'll use the project ID `212` and invite each user with a Developer access level (30). Let's proceed with this step.
