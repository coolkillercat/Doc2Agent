CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Show me the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with Circe fleece***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with the "Circe fleece," I need to identify tools related to customer reviews or feedback. Let's look for tools that might help us find customer reviews or feedback related to products.

I'll start by checking the documentation for tools that might be related to customer reviews or feedback. Since there are many tools, I'll focus on those that seem relevant to customer interactions or product reviews.

Let's start by checking the documentation for the `search_products_by_name` tool to see if it can help us find reviews or feedback related to the "Circe fleece."
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_name.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name` tool allows us to search for products by their names using SQL LIKE syntax. However, it doesn't directly provide customer reviews or feedback. 

To find the most unhappy customer, we need to look for tools that might provide customer reviews or feedback. Let's check the documentation for the `search_customers_GET` tool to see if it can help us find customer feedback or reviews related to the "Circe fleece."
CODE:
get_documentation('search_customers_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_customers_GET.py
'"""\nSearch for customers based on specified criteria.\n    \n    Args:\n        field (str): The field to filter by (e.g., \'email\', \'firstname\', \'lastname\')\n        value (str): The value to filter for\n        condition_type (str): The condition type for filtering (e.g., \'eq\', \'like\', \'gt\')\n        sort_field (str): Field to sort results by (e.g., \'created_at\', \'email\')\n        sort_direction (str): Direction to sort (\'ASC\' or \'DESC\')\n        page_size (int): Number of results per page\n        current_page (int): Current page number\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns customer records matching specified search criteria with their personal information, addresses, and account details.\n    Example:\n        >>> search_customers(field=\'email\', value=\'example@example.com\')\n        >>> search_customers(field=\'firstname\', value=\'John\', sort_field=\'created_at\', sort_direction=\'DESC\')\n""" example: search_customers(field=\'email\', value=\'emma.lopez@gmail.com\', sort_field=\'created_at\', sort_direction=\'ASC\')'

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_customers_GET` tool allows us to search for customers based on specified criteria, such as email, first name, or last name. However, it doesn't directly provide customer reviews or feedback.

To find the most unhappy customer, we need to look for tools that might provide customer reviews or feedback. Let's check the documentation for the `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool to see if it can help us find customer feedback related to the "Circe fleece."
CODE:
get_documentation('list_comments_for_order_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/list_comments_for_order_GET.py
'"""\nLists comments for a specified order.\n    \n    Args:\n        id (int): The order ID. Required.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of comments for a specified order including the comment text, creation date, and visibility settings.\n    Example:\n        >>> response = list_comments_for_order(id=123)\n        >>> print(response.status_code)\n        200\n""" example: list_comments_for_order(id=123)'

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool lists comments for a specified order, including the comment text, creation date, and visibility settings. However, it requires an order ID, and it doesn't directly provide product-specific feedback.

To find the most unhappy customer for the "Circe fleece," we need to identify tools that might provide product reviews or feedback. Let's check the documentation for the `search_products_by_keyword` tool to see if it can help us find reviews or feedback related to the "Circe fleece."
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_keyword', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_keyword.py

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_keyword` tool allows us to search for products matching a specific keyword, but it doesn't directly provide customer reviews or feedback.

To find the most unhappy customer for the "Circe fleece," we need to identify tools that might provide customer reviews or feedback. Since none of the tools we've checked so far seem to provide direct access to customer reviews, let's try using the `search_orders` tool to find orders containing the "Circe fleece" and then look for any associated comments or feedback.

I'll check the documentation for the `search_orders` tool to see if it can help us find orders containing the "Circe fleece."
CODE:
get_documentation('search_orders', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_orders.py
'"""\nSearches for orders based on specified criteria, with support for pagination, sorting, and field selection.\n    \n    Args:\n        field (str): The field to search on\n        value (str): The value to search for\n        condition_type (str, optional): The condition type for filtering.

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders` tool allows us to search for orders based on specified criteria, including fields like order status, with support for pagination, sorting, and field selection. However, it doesn't directly provide product-specific feedback or reviews.

To find the most unhappy customer for the "Circe fleece," we need to identify orders containing this product and then look for any associated comments or feedback. Since the tools we've explored so far don't directly provide product reviews, let's try using the `search_products_by_name` tool to find the SKU for "Circe fleece" and then use that SKU to search for orders.

I'll call the `search_products_by_name` tool to find the SKU for "Circe fleece."
CODE:
from utils import call_function
call_function('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin', name_pattern='%Circe fleece%', page_size=1, return_fields=['sku', 'name'])

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search for the "Circe fleece" product by name did not return any results. This might be due to the product not being listed under that exact name or it might not exist in the current dataset.

To proceed, let's try searching for products using a broader keyword or check if there are any other tools that might help us find customer feedback or reviews related to products. Since the current approach didn't yield results, I'll explore the possibility of using the `search_products_by_keyword` tool with a broader keyword to see if we can find any related products.

I'll call the `search_products_by_keyword` tool with a broader keyword "fleece" to see if we can find any related products.

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search for products using the keyword "fleece" returned several items, but it doesn't directly provide customer reviews or feedback. To find the most unhappy customer, we need to identify orders containing these products and then look for any associated comments or feedback.

Let's proceed by using the `search_orders` tool to find orders containing any of these products. I'll start by retrieving the full response to identify the SKUs or IDs of the products returned in the search.

I'll retrieve the full response to explore the product details.
CODE:
from utils import get_response, list_all_paths
# Retrieve the full response to explore product details
list_all_paths('response_2')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
'Available paths in response_2 (depth ≤ 10):\n  [items]\n  [items][0]\n  [items][0][id]\n  [items][0][custom_attributes]\n  [items][0][custom_attributes][0]\n  [items][0][custom_attributes][0][attribute_code]\n  [items][0][custom_attributes][0][value]\n  [items][1]\n  [items][1][id]\n  [items][1][custom_attributes]\n  [items][1][custom_attributes][0]\n  [items][1][custom_attributes][0][attribute_code]\n  [items][1][custom_attributes][0][value]\n  [items][2]\n  [items][2][id]\n  [items][2][custom_attributes]\n  [items][2][custom_attributes][0]\n  [items][2][custom_attributes][0][attribute_code]\n  [items][2][custom_attributes][0][value]\n  [items][...]\n  [aggregations]\n  [aggregations][buckets]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][name]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][0]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][0][value]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][0][metrics]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][0][metrics][0]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][0][metrics][1]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][1]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][1][value]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][1][metrics]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][1][metrics][0]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][1][metrics][1]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][2]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][2][value]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][2][metrics]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][2][metrics][0]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][2][metrics][1]\n  [aggregations][buckets][0][values][...]\n  [aggregations][bucket_names]\n  [aggregations][bucket_names][0]\n  [search_criteria]\n  [search_criteria][request_name]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][0]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][0][filters]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][0][filters][0]\n  [search_criteria][filter_groups][0][filters][0][field]\n\n... (showing first 50 paths)'

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response contains product IDs and custom attributes, but it doesn't directly provide SKUs or names. To proceed, I'll extract the product IDs and use them to search for orders containing these products.

Let's extract the product IDs from the response and then use the `search_orders` tool to find orders containing these products.
CODE:
# Extract product IDs from the response
product_ids = get_response('response_2', 'id')
product_ids
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
'Search results for \'id\' in response_2 (showing first 10 of 27 total matches):\n\nLine 4:     {\n      "id": 1210,\n      "custom_attributes": [\n\n---\n\nLine 13:     {\n      "id": 382,\n      "custom_attributes": [\n\n---\n\nLine 22:     {\n      "id": 1178,\n      "custom_attributes": [\n\n---\n\nLine 31:     {\n      "id": 828,\n      "custom_attributes": [\n\n---\n\nLine 40:     {\n      "id": 1076,\n      "custom_attributes": [\n\n---\n\nLine 49:     {\n      "id": 1252,\n      "custom_attributes": [\n\n---\n\nLine 58:     {\n      "id": 802,\n      "custom_attributes": [\n\n---\n\nLine 67:     {\n      "id": 1380,\n      "custom_attributes": [\n\n---\n\nLine 76:     {\n      "id": 222,\n      "custom_attributes": [\n\n---\n\nLine 85:     {\n      "id": 270,\n      "custom_attributes": [\n\n... [Showing first 10 of 27 matches]\n💡 TIP: Instead of viewing all 27 matches, consider using navigation tools:\n   search_key(\'response_2\', \'key_name\') - find specific keys\n   search_value(\'response_2\', \'value\') - find specific values\n   get_value_at_path(\'response_2\', \'[path]\') - get exact values'

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: I have extracted the product IDs from the response. Now, I'll use these product IDs to search for orders containing these products using the `search_orders` tool. This will help us identify orders that include the "fleece" products.

Let's proceed by calling the `search_orders` tool with one of the product IDs to find related orders.
CODE:
# Use one of the product IDs to search for related orders
call_function('search_orders', site='shopping_admin', field='product_id', value='1210', condition_type='eq', page_size=1)

{'status_code': 500,

 '_original_response': <Response [500]>}

Step 16:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that there was an internal error when trying to search for orders using the product ID. This might be due to an issue with the API or the specific query parameters used.

Since the direct approach of searching for orders by product ID resulted in an error, let's try a different approach. We can attempt to search for customer reviews or feedback using other available tools or by exploring customer-related data.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_orders_with_multiple_conditions` tool to see if it can help us find orders with specific conditions that might include customer feedback or comments.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_orders_with_multiple_conditions', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_orders_with_multiple_conditions.py

Step 17:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_with_multiple_conditions` tool allows us to search for orders using multiple filter conditions with logical AND between condition groups and logical OR within each group. It can return basic order information, including customer email, IDs, and status.

To find the most unhappy customer, we can use this tool to search for orders that might include negative feedback or comments. However, since we don't have direct access to feedback data, we might need to explore other tools or approaches.

Given the constraints, let's attempt to search for orders with specific conditions that might indicate dissatisfaction, such as orders with comments or specific statuses. I'll try using this tool to search for orders with comments, which might include feedback.

Let's proceed by calling the `search_orders_with_multiple_conditions` tool with conditions to find orders with comments.

THOUGHT: The search returned an order with the status "complete" and the customer email "janesmith456@yahoo.com." However, this doesn't directly indicate dissatisfaction or negative feedback.

To find the most unhappy customer, we need to identify orders with negative feedback or comments. Since the current approach didn't yield the desired results, let's try using the `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool to check for comments on this order, which might include feedback.

I'll call the `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool to see if there are any comments associated with this order.
