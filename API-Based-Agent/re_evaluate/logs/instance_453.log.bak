CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Disable Teton pullover hoodie from the site, they are facing some quality issues.***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To disable the "Teton pullover hoodie," I need to find the appropriate tool for updating or disabling a product. Based on the list of available tools, the `create_product_PUT` or `create_product_POST` might be relevant for updating product status. However, I need to confirm which tool is suitable for disabling a product.

I'll start by checking the documentation for the `create_product_PUT` tool to see if it allows disabling a product.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('create_product_PUT', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/create_product_PUT.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_product_PUT` tool allows us to update a product's status by setting the `status` parameter. To disable a product, we need to set the `status` to `2`.

Next, I'll search for the "Teton pullover hoodie" to find its SKU, which is necessary for updating the product status. I'll use the `search_products_by_name` tool to find the product by its name.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_products_by_name` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin')

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name` tool allows us to search for products using a name pattern with SQL LIKE syntax. We can use `%` as a wildcard to match parts of the product name.

I'll search for the "Teton pullover hoodie" using this tool to find its SKU.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Search for the "Teton pullover hoodie" to find its SKU
response = call_function('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin',
                         name_pattern='%Teton pullover hoodie%',

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search result shows that the SKU for the "Teton Pullover Hoodie-XS-Black" is `MH02-XS-Black`.

Now, I'll proceed to disable this product by updating its status using the `create_product_PUT` tool. I'll set the `status` to `2` to disable the product.

Let's perform this action.
CODE:
# Disable the "Teton Pullover Hoodie-XS-Black" by setting its status to 2
disable_response = call_function('create_product_PUT', site='shopping_admin',
                                 sku='MH02-XS-Black',

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the `create_product_PUT` tool requires the `price` parameter as well. I'll include the `price` parameter in the request to disable the product. Since the price is not specified in the task, I'll retrieve the current price of the product first.

I'll use the `get_product_list_GET` tool to retrieve the product details, including the price, for the "Teton Pullover Hoodie-XS-Black."

Let's check the documentation for the `get_product_list_GET` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:

Step 11:
