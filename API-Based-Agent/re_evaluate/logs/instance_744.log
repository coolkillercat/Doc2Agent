Step 0:

CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Create a new public project "AutoAGI" and add primer as members***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_project` tool allows us to create a new GitLab project with various customizable settings. To create a new public project named "AutoAGI", we need to specify the `name` and `visibility` parameters. We will set the `visibility` to "public".

Let's proceed to create the project "AutoAGI" with public visibility.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The project "AutoAGI" has been successfully created with public visibility. Now, let's proceed to add "primer" as members to this project. We'll need to use the tools in the "members" category to achieve this.

First, let's list the available tools in the "members" category to find the appropriate tool for adding members.

Step 9:

We need to specify the `id` of the project, the `access_level`, and either the `email` or `user_id` of the new member. Since we want to add "primer" as members, we need to determine their user ID or email.

Let's first retrieve the user ID for "primer" using the tools in the "users" category.

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have successfully retrieved the user ID for "primer", which is `2367`. Now, let's proceed to invite "primer" as a member to the "AutoAGI" project using the `invite_member` tool. We'll use the project ID `207` and the user ID `2367`, and set an appropriate access level.

Let's proceed with inviting "primer" to the project.
CODE:
# Invite "primer" to the "AutoAGI" project with a specified access level
invite_response = call_function('invite_member', site='gitlab', category='members',
                                id='207',  # Project ID for AutoAGI
                                user_id=2367,  # User ID for primer
                                access_level=30,  # Developer access level
                                target_type='project')
print(invite_response)

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with the request. The error message indicates that we must provide either an email or user_id as a parameter. Since we already provided the `user_id`, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the API call.

Let's try using the `add_member_to_group_or_project` tool instead, which might be more appropriate for adding a user to a project. First, I'll check the documentation for this tool to ensure we use it correctly.
CODE:
# Get documentation for the add_member_to_group_or_project tool
get_documentation('add_member_to_group_or_project', site='gitlab', category='projects')

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `add_member_to_group_or_project` tool is designed to add a user as a member to a GitLab project with a specified access level. We need to provide the `id` of the project, the `user_id` of the new member, and the `access_level`. The `location_type` should be set to `'project'`.

Let's proceed to add "primer" as a member to the "AutoAGI" project using this tool.
CODE:
# Add "primer" as a member to the "AutoAGI" project
add_member_response = call_function('add_member_to_group_or_project', site='gitlab', category='projects',
                                    id='207',  # Project ID for AutoAGI
                                    user_id='2367',  # User ID for primer
                                    access_level=30,  # Developer access level
