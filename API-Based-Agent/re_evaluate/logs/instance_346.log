Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***How many reviews our shop received during 2022?***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: To find out how many reviews the shop received during 2022, I need to identify the appropriate tool for retrieving review data. From the list of available tools, it seems there isn't a direct tool named for fetching reviews. However, I will look for any tool related to reviews or feedback.

Since the list is extensive, I'll search for any tool that might be related to reviews or feedback. If none is found, I might need to explore further or consider alternative approaches.

Let's start by checking if there is any tool related to reviews or feedback by searching for relevant keywords in the tool list.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 7:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Since there isn't a direct tool for fetching reviews in the list, I'll search for any tool that might be related to reviews or feedback by checking the documentation of tools that might be relevant. I'll start by checking the documentation for any tool that might be related to customer interactions or feedback.

Let's begin by examining the documentation for a tool that might be related to customer interactions or feedback. I'll start with the `search_customers_GET` tool, as it might provide insights into customer-related data, which could include reviews.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_customers_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_customers_GET` tool is designed for searching customer records based on specified criteria, but it doesn't seem directly related to retrieving reviews.

Since there isn't a direct tool for reviews, I'll now look for any tool that might be related to orders or products, as reviews are often associated with these entities. I'll check the documentation for the `list_orders_GET` tool, as it might provide insights into order-related data, which could include reviews or feedback.

Let's examine the documentation for the `list_orders_GET` tool.
CODE:
get_documentation('list_orders_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_orders_GET` tool is designed to list orders based on specified search criteria, but it doesn't seem directly related to retrieving reviews.

Since there isn't a direct tool for reviews, I'll now look for any tool that might be related to products, as reviews are often associated with these entities. I'll check the documentation for the `get_product_list_GET` tool, as it might provide insights into product-related data, which could include reviews or feedback.

Let's examine the documentation for the `get_product_list_GET` tool.
CODE:

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_product_list_GET` tool is designed to retrieve a list of products with filtering, sorting, and pagination options, but it doesn't seem directly related to retrieving reviews.

Since none of the tools examined so far are directly related to reviews, I'll now search for any tool that might be related to comments or feedback, as reviews might be categorized under these terms. I'll check the documentation for the `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool, as it might provide insights into comments or feedback related to orders, which could include reviews.

Let's examine the documentation for the `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool.
CODE:
get_documentation('list_comments_for_order_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/list_comments_for_order_GET.py

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool lists comments for a specified order, but it requires an order ID and doesn't directly provide a way to list all reviews or comments across multiple orders.

Since none of the tools directly provide a way to list all reviews, I'll now consider using a tool that might allow searching for reviews or comments across a broader scope. I'll check the documentation for the `search_orders_by_date_range` tool, as it might allow searching for orders within a specific date range, which could include reviews or comments.

Let's examine the documentation for the `search_orders_by_date_range` tool.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_orders_by_date_range', site='shopping_admin')

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_date_range` tool allows searching for orders created within a specific date range. While it doesn't directly provide reviews, it can be used to retrieve orders from 2022, and then I can check if any of these orders have associated comments or feedback that might be considered reviews.

I'll proceed by using the `search_orders_by_date_range` tool to retrieve orders from the year 2022. Once I have the orders, I can explore if there are any comments or feedback associated with them.

Let's call the `search_orders_by_date_range` tool to get orders from 2022.

 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response for the orders from 2022 is quite large and has been truncated. To proceed, I'll explore the structure of the response to identify any paths related to comments or reviews. This will help determine if there are any reviews or feedback associated with the orders.

Let's list all available JSON paths in the response to understand its structure.
CODE:
from utils import list_all_paths
list_all_paths('response_1')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
'Available paths in response_1 (depth ≤ 10):\n  [items]\n  [items][0]\n  [items][0][applied_rule_ids]\n  [items][0][base_currency_code]\n  [items][0][base_discount_amount]\n  [items][0][base_grand_total]\n  [items][0][base_discount_tax_compensation_amount]\n  [items][0][base_shipping_amount]\n  [items][0][base_shipping_discount_amount]\n  [items][0][base_shipping_discount_tax_compensation_amnt]\n  [items][0][base_shipping_incl_tax]\n  [items][0][base_shipping_tax_amount]\n  [items][0][base_subtotal]\n  [items][0][base_subtotal_incl_tax]\n  [items][0][base_tax_amount]\n  [items][0][base_total_due]\n  [items][0][base_to_global_rate]\n  [items][0][base_to_order_rate]\n  [items][0][billing_address_id]\n  [items][0][created_at]\n  [items][0][customer_email]\n  [items][0][customer_firstname]\n  [items][0][customer_group_id]\n  [items][0][customer_id]\n  [items][0][customer_is_guest]\n  [items][0][customer_lastname]\n  [items][0][customer_note_notify]\n  [items][0][discount_amount]\n  [items][0][email_sent]\n  [items][0][entity_id]\n  [items][0][global_currency_code]\n  [items][0][grand_total]\n  [items][0][discount_tax_compensation_amount]\n  [items][0][increment_id]\n  [items][0][is_virtual]\n  [items][0][order_currency_code]\n  [items][0][protect_code]\n  [items][0][quote_id]\n  [items][0][remote_ip]\n  [items][0][shipping_amount]\n  [items][0][shipping_description]\n  [items][0][shipping_discount_amount]\n  [items][0][shipping_discount_tax_compensation_amount]\n  [items][0][shipping_incl_tax]\n  [items][0][shipping_tax_amount]\n  [items][0][state]\n  [items][0][status]\n  [items][0][store_currency_code]\n  [items][0][store_id]\n  [items][0][store_name]\n\n... (showing first 50 paths)'

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response contains a list of orders with various details, but it doesn't seem to include any direct paths related to comments or reviews. Since reviews might be associated with comments, I'll search for any paths related to comments within the response.

Let's search for any paths containing the word "comment" to see if there are any comments associated with the orders.
CODE:
from utils import search_key
search_key('response_1', 'comment')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
"Found 1 key paths matching 'comment' in response_1:\n  [items][76][status_histories][0][comment]"

Step 16:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: I found a path related to comments: `[items][76][status_histories][0][comment]`. This indicates that comments are part of the `status_histories` for orders. To determine how many reviews (or comments) were received during 2022, I'll need to count the number of comments across all orders.

Let's retrieve the full response and count the number of comments in the `status_histories` for all orders.
CODE:
from utils import get_response

# Retrieve the full response data
full_data = get_response('response_1')

# Count the number of comments in the status_histories
comment_count = 0
for order in full_data.get('items', []):
    status_histories = order.get('status_histories', [])
    for history in status_histories:
        if 'comment' in history:
            comment_count += 1

     10     for history in status_histories:

AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'

Step 17:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error because the response was treated as a string instead of a JSON object. I'll convert the response to a JSON object and then count the number of comments in the `status_histories`.

Let's correct this and count the comments again.
CODE:
import json

# Convert the response to a JSON object
full_data_json = json.loads(full_data)

# Count the number of comments in the status_histories
comment_count = 0
for order in full_data_json.get('items', []):

    356 return obj, end

JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Step 18:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with converting the response to JSON. The `get_response` function should return a JSON object, but it appears to be returning a string. I'll try retrieving the response again and ensure it's correctly parsed as JSON.

Let's retrieve the response and parse it correctly.

Step 19:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is still an issue with the response being treated as a string. I will ensure that the response is correctly parsed as a JSON object by using the `json.loads()` function on the content of the response.

Let's try parsing the response content correctly and count the comments again.
