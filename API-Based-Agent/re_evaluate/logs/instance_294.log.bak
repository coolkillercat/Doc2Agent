Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Show me the command to clone ChatGPT with SSH.***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in a specific category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
# Then, get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
# Finally, call the function with appropriate parameters
call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id='183', commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 1:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: An error occurred while processing your request. Please try again.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 2:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the command to clone the ChatGPT project with SSH from GitLab, I will follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the 'projects' category to find a tool that can provide project details.
2. Get documentation for the relevant tool to understand how to use it.
3. Call the function to retrieve the SSH URL for the ChatGPT project.

Let's start by listing the available tools in the 'projects' category.
CODE:

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool `get_project_details` seems to be the one that can provide detailed information about a specific project, including repository URLs. I will now get the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('get_project_details', site='gitlab', category='projects')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/projects/get_project_details.py

Useful for project management and monitoring.\n    \n    Args:\n        project_id: The ID of the project to retrieve\n        include_license: Include project license data\n        include_statistics: Include project statistics (requires at least Reporter role)\n        include_custom_attributes: Include custom attributes in response (administrators only)\n        \n    Returns:\n        Retrieves detailed information about a specific project, including description, visibility, repository URLs, and other project metadata.\n""" example: get_project_details(project_id=183, include_statistics=True)'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_project_details` tool retrieves detailed information about a specific project, including repository URLs. To find the SSH URL for cloning the ChatGPT project, I will call this function with the appropriate project ID.

Let's proceed to call the function to get the project details for ChatGPT.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Assuming the project ID for ChatGPT is known. For demonstration, let's assume it's '123'.
project_id = 123
project_details = call_function('get_project_details', site='gitlab', category='projects', project_id=project_id)
print(project_details)

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response was truncated, but it includes the SSH URL for the repository. To ensure we have the complete SSH URL, I'll retrieve the full response and extract the SSH URL.

Let's retrieve the full response to get the SSH URL.
CODE:
from utils import get_response

# Retrieve the full response to get the SSH URL
full_response = get_response('response_1')
print(full_response)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
