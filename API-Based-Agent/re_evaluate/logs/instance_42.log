CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***List the top 2 search terms in my store***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The list of available tools for the `shopping_admin` site is extensive, but I need to identify a tool that can help retrieve search term data. Based on the tool names, none of them explicitly mention search terms. However, there might be a tool related to search analytics or reports that could provide this information.

To proceed, I'll look for any tool that might relate to search analytics or reports. If none are found, I may need to explore the documentation of a few tools that seem relevant to ensure I don't miss any functionality.

Let's start by checking the documentation for any tool that might relate to search analytics or reports. I'll begin with the `catalog_view_search` tool, as it might provide insights into search behavior.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('catalog_view_search', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/catalog_view_search.py
'"""\nRetrieves products from specific categories with optional price range and visibility filters, similar to browsing catalog pages on a storefront.\n    \n    Args:\n        category_ids (list): List of category IDs to search within\n        price_from (float, optional): Minimum price filter for products\n        price_to (float, optional): Maximum price filter for products\n        visibility (str, optional): Product visibility setting\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns product search results from specified categories with optional price range and visibility filters, including matching items and aggregated data.\n""" example: catalog_view_search(category_ids=[4])  # Example: Search in category ID 4'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `catalog_view_search` tool is designed to retrieve products from specific categories with optional price range and visibility filters. It doesn't seem to provide information about search terms or search analytics.

Since this tool doesn't meet our needs, I'll look for another tool that might be related to search analytics or reports. Given the extensive list of tools, I'll now check the documentation for the `search_products_by_keyword` tool, as it might provide insights into search term usage.

Let's proceed with that:
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_keyword', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_keyword.py
'"""\nSearches for products matching a specific keyword, with optional boost value to influence search relevance.\n    \n    Args:\n        keyword (str): The search term to look for in products\n        boost_value (int, optional): Custom boost value to influence search relevance\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns search results for products matching a specified keyword with optional relevance boosting.\n""" example: search_products_by_keyword("digital watch")'

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_keyword` tool is used to search for products matching a specific keyword, with an optional boost value to influence search relevance. However, it doesn't provide information about the most popular or top search terms.

Since neither of these tools provides the needed information, I'll look for any tool that might relate to analytics or reports, which could potentially include search term data. Given the extensive list, I'll now check the documentation for the `search_recent_orders` tool, as it might provide insights into recent search activity.

Let's proceed with that:
CODE:
get_documentation('search_recent_orders', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_recent_orders.py
'"""\nRetrieves orders placed within the specified number of hours, useful for monitoring recent sales activity.\n    \n    Args:\n        hours (int): Number of hours to look back for orders.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_recent_orders` tool retrieves orders placed within a specified number of hours and is useful for monitoring recent sales activity. However, it doesn't provide information about search terms or search analytics.

Since none of the tools I've checked so far provide the needed information about search terms, I'll now look for any tool that might relate to analytics or reports, which could potentially include search term data. Given the extensive list, I'll now check the documentation for the `get_enabled_modules_GET` tool, as it might provide insights into available modules that could include search analytics.

Let's proceed with that:
CODE:
get_documentation('get_enabled_modules_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/get_enabled_modules_GET.py
'"""\nGet a list of all enabled modules in the Magento installation.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of all enabled modules in the Magento installation.\n    Example:\n        >>> response = get_enabled_modules()\n        >>> modules = response.json()\n        >>> print(modules[0])  # Example: "Magento_Store"\n""" example: get_enabled_modules()'

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_enabled_modules_GET` tool provides a list of all enabled modules in the Magento installation. It doesn't provide information about search terms or search analytics.

Since none of the tools I've checked so far provide the needed information about search terms, I'll now look for any tool that might relate to analytics or reports, which could potentially include search term data.

THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_date_range` tool searches for orders created within a specific date range, which is useful for periodic reporting or synchronization. However, it doesn't provide information about search terms or search analytics.

Given the extensive list of tools and the lack of a direct tool for search term analytics, I will now check the documentation for the `search_orders_by_status` tool, as it might provide insights into search term usage or related analytics.

Let's proceed with that:
CODE:
get_documentation('search_orders_by_status', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_status` tool searches for orders with a specific status, but it doesn't provide information about search terms or search analytics.

Given the extensive list of tools and the lack of a direct tool for search term analytics, I will now check the documentation for the `search_orders_with_and_conditions` tool, as it might provide insights into search term usage or related analytics.

Let's proceed with that:
CODE:
get_documentation('search_orders_with_and_conditions', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

THOUGHT: It seems that none of the tools I've explored so far provide direct information about the most popular or top search terms. Given the extensive list of tools and the lack of a direct tool for search term analytics, I will now check the documentation for the `search_orders_with_multiple_conditions` tool, as it might provide insights into search term usage or related analytics.

Let's proceed with that:
