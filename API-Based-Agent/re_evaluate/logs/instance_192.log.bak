Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Tell me the total cost of my latest non-cancelled order?***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To find the total cost of your latest non-cancelled order, I'll follow these steps:

1. List the available tools to find the appropriate ones for order retrieval.
2. Use the relevant tool to search for your orders.
3. Filter the orders to find the latest non-cancelled one.
4. Calculate the total cost of that order.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the total cost of your latest non-cancelled order, I will use the following approach:

1. Use the `search_orders_by_customer_admin` tool to find all orders placed by you.
2. Filter these orders to find the latest one that is not cancelled.
3. Retrieve the total cost of that order.

Let's start by checking the documentation for the `search_orders_by_customer_admin` tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_orders_by_customer_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_orders_by_customer_admin.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_customer_admin` tool allows us to search for all orders placed by a specific customer. We need to provide the `customer_id` to retrieve the orders. Since we know your email, we first need to find your `customer_id`.

Let's proceed with the following steps:
1. Use the `search_customers_GET_admin` tool to find your `customer_id` using your email.
2. Use the `search_orders_by_customer_admin` tool with your `customer_id` to retrieve your orders.
3. Identify the latest non-cancelled order and calculate its total cost.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `search_customers_GET_admin` tool to find your `customer_id`.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_customers_GET_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_customers_GET_admin.py

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_customers_GET_admin` tool allows us to search for customers using specific criteria, such as email. We can use this tool to find your `customer_id` by searching with your email address.

Let's proceed to find your `customer_id` using your email `emma.lopez@gmail.com`.
CODE:

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response contains a list of your orders, but it was truncated. To find the latest non-cancelled order, I'll retrieve the full response and search for the order with a status other than "canceled."

Let's retrieve the full response and analyze it.
CODE:
# Retrieve the full response to analyze the orders
full_orders_response = get_response('response_2')

# Find the latest non-cancelled order
latest_non_cancelled_order = None
for order in full_orders_response['content']['items']:
    if order['status'] != 'canceled':
        latest_non_cancelled_order = order
        break

# Display the total cost of the latest non-cancelled order
latest_non_cancelled_order_total = latest_non_cancelled_order['grand_total'] if latest_non_cancelled_order else None
latest_non_cancelled_order_total
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[1], line 2
      1 # Retrieve the full response to analyze the orders
----> 2 full_orders_response = get_response('response_2')
      4 # Find the latest non-cancelled order
      5 latest_non_cancelled_order = None

NameError: name 'get_response' is not defined

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error because the `get_response` function was not defined in the current context. Let me correct that and retrieve the full response again to find the latest non-cancelled order.

I'll redefine the necessary imports and proceed with the analysis.
CODE:
from utils import get_response

# Retrieve the full response to analyze the orders
full_orders_response = get_response('response_2')

# Find the latest non-cancelled order
latest_non_cancelled_order = None
for order in full_orders_response['content']['items']:
    if order['status'] != 'canceled':
        latest_non_cancelled_order = order
        break

# Display the total cost of the latest non-cancelled order
latest_non_cancelled_order_total = latest_non_cancelled_order['grand_total'] if latest_non_cancelled_order else None
latest_non_cancelled_order_total
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[1], line 8
      6 # Find the latest non-cancelled order
      7 latest_non_cancelled_order = None
----> 8 for order in full_orders_response['content']['items']:
      9     if order['status'] != 'canceled':
     10         latest_non_cancelled_order = order

KeyError: 'content'

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue accessing the response content. Let's retrieve the full response again and ensure we access the correct structure.

I'll retrieve the full response and check its structure to correctly identify the latest non-cancelled order.
CODE:
# Retrieve the full response to analyze the orders
full_orders_response = get_response('response_2')

# Check the structure of the full response
full_orders_response

Step 13:

THOUGHT: The full response shows the structure of your orders. Now, let's find the latest non-cancelled order and calculate its total cost.

I'll proceed with identifying the latest non-cancelled order.
CODE:
# Find the latest non-cancelled order
latest_non_cancelled_order = None
for order in full_orders_response['items']:
    if order['status'] != 'canceled':
        latest_non_cancelled_order = order
        break

# Display the total cost of the latest non-cancelled order
latest_non_cancelled_order_total = latest_non_cancelled_order['grand_total'] if latest_non_cancelled_order else None
latest_non_cancelled_order_total
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
754.99

Step 14:
act - AgentFinishAction(outputs={}, thought='Finish[754.99]', action='finish')
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')
