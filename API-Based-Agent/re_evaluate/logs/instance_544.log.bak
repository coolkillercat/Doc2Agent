CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Update the description of Selena Yoga Hoodie to highlight the real user positive reviews by quoting the comments***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: To update the description of the "Selena Yoga Hoodie" with real user positive reviews, we need to:

1. Search for the product "Selena Yoga Hoodie" to get its details.
2. Retrieve user reviews for this product.
3. Extract positive reviews and update the product description.

Let's start by searching for the product using the `search_products_by_name` tool to find the "Selena Yoga Hoodie."
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Now that we have the documentation for the `search_products_by_name` tool, we can proceed to search for the "Selena Yoga Hoodie" using this tool. We'll use the name pattern to find the product details.

Let's execute the search for the product.

act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search did not return any results for the "Selena Yoga Hoodie." This could be due to a mismatch in the product name or it might not exist in the database.

Let's try a broader search to see if we can find any products related to "Selena Yoga" and then refine our search from there. I'll adjust the search pattern to be more inclusive.

Step 9:

THOUGHT: It appears that the search for products related to "Selena Yoga" also returned no results. This might indicate that the product name is different from what we expected, or it might not be present in the database.

To proceed, let's try a more general search for products with the keyword "Yoga" to see if we can find any related products. This will help us identify if there are any products with similar names or if the product is missing entirely.

I'll perform a search using the keyword "Yoga."

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search for products with the keyword "Yoga" returned several results, but none of them are named "Selena Yoga Hoodie." Here are the products found:

1. Josie Yoga Jacket
2. Jade Yoga Jacket
3. Karmen Yoga Pant-28-Black
4. Karmen Yoga Pant-28-Gray
5. Karmen Yoga Pant-28-White

Since the "Selena Yoga Hoodie" is not listed, it might not exist in the database, or it could be under a different name. 

To proceed, we can try searching for reviews related to any of these products to see if they might be relevant. Let's start by checking the available tools for retrieving product reviews.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_products` tool to understand its capabilities and see if it can help us retrieve reviews or additional product details.
