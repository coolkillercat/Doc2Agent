act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Update the product description of Antonia Racer Tank to highlight the real user positive reviews by quoting the comments***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: To proceed with updating the product description of "Antonia Racer Tank" with positive user reviews, we need to:

1. Search for the product "Antonia Racer Tank" to get its details.
2. Retrieve user reviews for this product.
3. Update the product description with selected positive reviews.

Let's start by searching for the product "Antonia Racer Tank" using the `search_products_by_name` tool. I'll check the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters.

Step 7:
