Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Cancel order 299***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool `cancel_order_POST` is available for canceling orders. Next, I'll check the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters for canceling order 299.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('cancel_order_POST', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/cancel_order_POST.py
'"""\nCancels a specified order.\n    \n    Args:\n        id (int): The order ID to cancel. This parameter is required.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns a boolean value indicating whether the specified order was successfully canceled.\n    Example:\n        >>> response = cancel_order(id=40)\n        >>> print(response.status_code)\n        200\n        >>> print(response.json())\n        True\n""" example: cancel_order(id=40)'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `cancel_order_POST` tool requires an `id` parameter, which is the order ID to cancel. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the order was successfully canceled.

Now, I'll proceed to call this function to cancel order 299.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
response = call_function('cancel_order_POST', site='shopping_admin', id=299)
response
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: cancel_order_POST
site: shopping_admin
parameter: id=299

content: True

[Response stored as 'response_1' - use get_value_at_path('response_1', '[path]') to access specific data]
{'status_code': 200,
 'content': "Response contains 4 characters. Use navigation tools with response_id 'response_1' to explore the data.",

 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_1',
 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 8:
act - AgentFinishAction(outputs={}, thought='The order 299 was successfully canceled, as indicated by the status code 200 and the content `True`.\n\nFinish[Order 299 has been successfully canceled.]', action='finish')
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')
