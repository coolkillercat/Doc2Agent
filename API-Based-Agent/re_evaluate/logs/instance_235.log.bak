Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Get the order number of my most recent under delivery order ***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the order number of your most recent under delivery order, I'll follow these steps:

1. List the available tools to find the appropriate API for searching orders.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool to understand how to use it.
3. Use the tool to search for your orders, filtering for those that are under delivery.
4. Identify the most recent order from the results.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find your most recent under delivery order, I will use the `search_orders_by_status_admin` tool, which allows searching for orders with a specific status. Let's first check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_orders_by_status_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_orders_by_status_admin.py
'"""\nSearches for orders with a specific status (e.g., \'pending\', \'processing\', \'complete\'), with support for pagination and sorting.\n    \n    Args:\n        status (str): Order status to filter by (e.g., \'pending\', \'processing\', \'complete\')\n        page_size (int, optional): Maximum number of items to return per page\n        current_page (int, optional): Current page number for pagination\n        sort_by (str, optional): Field to sort results by (e.g., \'created_at\', \'increment_id\')\n        sort_direction (str, optional): Sort direction, either \'ASC\' or \'DESC\'\n        return_fields (list, optional): List of fields to return in the response\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of orders filtered by status, including customer email and order identification details.\n""" example: search_orders_by_status(\'pending\', page_size=10, sort_by=\'created_at\', return_fields=[\'increment_id\', \'entity_id\', \'customer_email\'])'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_status_admin` tool allows us to search for orders with a specific status, such as 'pending', 'processing', or 'complete'. It supports pagination and sorting, and we can specify which fields to return.

To find your most recent under delivery order, I'll perform the following steps:
1. Use the tool to search for orders with the status 'processing' (assuming 'processing' indicates under delivery).
2. Sort the results by the 'created_at' field in descending order to get the most recent order first.
3. Filter the results to include only your orders by checking the customer email.

Let's proceed with calling the function to search for your orders with the status 'processing'.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for orders with status 'processing', sort by 'created_at' in descending order, and return relevant fields
result = call_function('search_orders_by_status_admin', site='shopping',
                       status='processing',
                       page_size=10,
                       sort_by='created_at',
                       sort_direction='DESC',
                       return_fields=['increment_id', 'entity_id', 'customer_email', 'created_at'])
print(result)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search for orders with the status 'processing' returned no results. This could mean that there are no orders currently under delivery with that status.

To ensure we cover all possibilities, let's try searching for orders with a broader status, such as 'pending', which might also indicate orders that are in the process of being delivered. I'll perform this search next.
CODE:
# Search for orders with status 'pending', sort by 'created_at' in descending order, and return relevant fields
result_pending = call_function('search_orders_by_status_admin', site='shopping',
                               status='pending',

                               sort_by='created_at',
                               sort_direction='DESC',
                               return_fields=['increment_id', 'entity_id', 'customer_email', 'created_at'])
