Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***I recently moved, my address is 654 Aspen Road, House #3, Boston, MA, 02110, update my information on OneStopShopping accordingly***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

1. List available API tools to find the appropriate ones for customer information and updates.
2. Use the tool to search for your customer information using your email.
3. Update your address using the appropriate API tool.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To update your address, I need to first find your customer information using your email. The tool `search_customers_GET_admin` seems appropriate for this task. Let's check its documentation to understand how to use it.
CODE:

Let's proceed with searching for your customer information.
CODE:

I'll retrieve the full response to examine your current address details.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Now that we have the address details, we can proceed to update your address. We need to find the appropriate tool for updating customer information. Let's check the documentation for a tool that allows updating customer addresses.

I'll look for a tool that can update customer information or addresses.

THOUGHT: The `set_customer_shipping_details` tool is used to set shipping and billing information for the customer's cart. However, it seems more related to cart operations rather than directly updating customer address information in the profile.

Since we need to update your address in your customer profile, let's look for a tool that specifically updates customer information or addresses. I'll check the list of tools again to see if there's a more suitable one for updating customer profiles.

Step 11:

THOUGHT: The attempt to update the address using `set_customer_shipping_details` resulted in a 404 error, indicating an issue with the shipping method. This tool seems to be more related to cart operations rather than updating the customer profile directly.

Since there isn't a specific tool listed for updating customer profiles, and the current approach didn't work, I will need to explore other potential options or tools that might not have been explicitly listed for updating customer addresses.

Let's try to find any other tool that might be suitable for updating customer information by checking the documentation for any tool that might have been overlooked.
