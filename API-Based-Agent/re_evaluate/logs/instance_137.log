Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To determine the estimated driving time between the city where the Liberty Bell is located and the home city of the Pirates, we need to identify these cities first:

1. The Liberty Bell is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
2. The home city of the Pirates is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Now, let's proceed step by step to find the estimated driving time between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh using the map API.

First, I'll list the available tools for the map site to see what options we have for calculating driving time.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the estimated driving time between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, we should use the `route_service_GET` tool, which is designed to find the fastest route between coordinates. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('route_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to get the fastest route between coordinates using the OSRM route service. We need to provide the coordinates for Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and specify the mode of transportation as 'driving'.

Let's find the coordinates for both cities:
- Philadelphia, PA: Latitude 39.9526, Longitude -75.1652
- Pittsburgh, PA: Latitude 40.4406, Longitude -79.9959

Now, I'll call the `route_service_GET` function to get the estimated driving time between these two cities.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Coordinates for Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
coordinates = '-75.1652,39.9526;-79.9959,40.4406'

# Call the route_service_GET function
