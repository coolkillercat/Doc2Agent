CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Show me the customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with Antonia racer tank?***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with the "Antonia racer tank," we need to identify tools related to customer feedback or reviews. Let's check the documentation for tools that might help us search for customer feedback or comments related to products.

I'll start by checking the documentation for the `search_products_by_name` tool to see if it can help us identify the product and then look for related feedback tools.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_name.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name` tool allows us to search for products by name using SQL LIKE syntax. This can help us identify the product "Antonia racer tank" by its name. However, to find customer dissatisfaction, we need to look for tools related to customer feedback or reviews.

Let's check the documentation for the `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool to see if it can help us find comments related to orders, which might include customer feedback.
CODE:
get_documentation('list_comments_for_order_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/list_comments_for_order_GET.py
'"""\nLists comments for a specified order.\n    \n    Args:\n        id (int): The order ID. Required.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of comments for a specified order including the comment text, creation date, and visibility settings.\n    Example:\n        >>> response = list_comments_for_order(id=123)\n        >>> print(response.status_code)\n        200\n""" example: list_comments_for_order(id=123)'

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool allows us to list comments for a specified order. This could potentially include customer feedback or dissatisfaction comments. However, to use this tool, we need to know the order IDs related to the "Antonia racer tank."

To proceed, we should first search for the product "Antonia racer tank" to get its SKU or other identifiers. Then, we can search for orders containing this product and retrieve comments for those orders.

Let's start by searching for the product "Antonia racer tank" using the `search_products_by_name` tool.
CODE:

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have successfully retrieved the SKUs and names for the "Antonia Racer Tank" in various colors and sizes. Now, we need to find orders containing these SKUs and retrieve comments for those orders to identify any dissatisfaction.

Next, I'll search for orders containing these SKUs using the `search_orders` tool. Let's start by checking the documentation for the `search_orders` tool to understand how to use it.

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders` tool allows us to search for orders based on specified criteria, including filtering by fields such as SKU. We can use this tool to find orders containing the SKUs of the "Antonia Racer Tank."

Let's proceed by searching for orders containing these SKUs. I'll start by searching for orders with one of the SKUs, "WT08-XS-Black," to demonstrate the process. Once we have the order IDs, we can retrieve comments for those orders to identify any dissatisfaction.
CODE:

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an internal error when attempting to search for orders with the SKU "WT08-XS-Black." This might be due to an issue with the API or the specific request parameters.

To proceed, let's try a different approach by searching for customer feedback directly related to the product. We can use the `search_customers_GET` tool to find customers who have left feedback or reviews mentioning dissatisfaction with the "Antonia racer tank."

I'll check the documentation for the `search_customers_GET` tool to see if it can help us find customers based on feedback or comments.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_customers_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_customers_GET.py

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_customers_GET` tool allows us to search for customers based on specified criteria, such as email, firstname, or lastname. However, it doesn't directly support searching for feedback or comments.

Since the previous approach encountered an error, let's try another method. We can attempt to search for orders using a different field or condition, such as searching by product name in the order items, if such functionality is available.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_orders_with_and_conditions` tool to see if it allows for more complex search criteria that might help us find orders containing the "Antonia racer tank."
CODE:
get_documentation('search_orders_with_and_conditions', site='shopping_admin')

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_with_and_conditions` tool allows us to search for orders using multiple filter conditions with logical AND between conditions. This could be useful for finding orders containing the "Antonia racer tank" by specifying conditions related to the product name or SKU.

Let's attempt to search for orders containing the "Antonia racer tank" by using a condition on the product name. I'll set up the search conditions to look for orders with items that have a name similar to "Antonia racer tank."
CODE:

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the attempt to search for orders containing items with the name "Antonia racer tank" also resulted in an internal error. This might indicate a broader issue with the API or the specific request parameters.

Given the challenges with directly searching for orders, let's try a different approach. We can attempt to search for customer reviews or feedback directly related to the product, if such functionality is available.

Let's check the documentation for the `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool again to see if it can be used in a different way to retrieve comments related to the product.
CODE:
get_documentation('list_comments_for_order_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/list_comments_for_order_GET.py
'"""\nLists comments for a specified order.\n    \n    Args:\n        id (int): The order ID. Required.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of comments for a specified order including the comment text, creation date, and visibility settings.\n    Example:\n        >>> response = list_comments_for_order(id=123)\n        >>> print(response.status_code)\n        200\n""" example: list_comments_for_order(id=123)'

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_comments_for_order_GET` tool requires an order ID to retrieve comments for that specific order. Since we encountered issues retrieving orders directly, we need to find another way to access customer feedback related to the "Antonia racer tank."

Given the constraints, let's attempt to search for customer feedback or reviews using a different tool or method. We can try using the `search_products_by_keyword` tool to see if it can help us find reviews or feedback related to the product.

I'll check the documentation for the `search_products_by_keyword` tool to see if it can be used to find customer feedback or reviews.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_keyword', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_keyword.py
'"""\nSearches for products matching a specific keyword, with optional boost value to influence search relevance.\n    \n    Args:\n        keyword (str): The search term to look for in products\n        boost_value (int, optional): Custom boost value to influence search relevance\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns search results for products matching a specified keyword with optional relevance boosting.\n""" example: search_products_by_keyword("digital watch")'
