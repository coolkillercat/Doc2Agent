CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Open an issue to report experiencing "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" during executions in aem-hacker.***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To proceed, I will use the `list_projects` tool to find the project ID for "aem-hacker". Once I have the project ID, I can use it to open an issue in the "issues" category.

Let's get the documentation for the `list_projects` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation

get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Now that we have the documentation for the `list_projects` tool, I will use it to search for the project "aem-hacker" to retrieve its project ID. This will allow us to open an issue in the next step.

Let's call the `list_projects` function with the search parameter set to "aem-hacker".

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: I have retrieved the project information for "aem-hacker". The project ID is 138. Now, I will proceed to open an issue in this project using the "issues" category.

First, I'll list the available tools in the "issues" category to find the appropriate tool for creating an issue.
CODE:
# List tools in the issues category to find the tool for creating an issue
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='issues')

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To create an issue in the "aem-hacker" project, I will use the `create_project_issue` tool. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters for creating an issue.
CODE:
# Get documentation for the create_project_issue tool
get_documentation('create_project_issue', site='gitlab', category='issues')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/workspace/api/gitlab/tools/issues/create_project_issue.py
"No module found for tool 'create_project_issue' in category 'issues' for site 'gitlab'"

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is no `create_project_issue` tool available in the "issues" category. However, there is a `list_issues` tool, which might provide a way to create issues indirectly or offer insights into how issues are managed.

Let's check the documentation for the `list_issues` tool to see if it provides any functionality related to creating issues or if it can guide us to another tool that might help.

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the `list_issues` tool is primarily for retrieving issues rather than creating them. Since there is no direct tool available for creating an issue, I will attempt to use the `create_project_issue` tool again, as it might have been overlooked in the list.

Let's try calling the `create_project_issue` function directly to see if it exists and can be used to create an issue in the "aem-hacker" project.
CODE:
# Attempt to call the create_project_issue function to create an issue
issue_creation_response = call_function('create_project_issue', site='gitlab', category='issues', project_id=138, title='OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use', description='Experiencing "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" during executions in aem-hacker.')
issue_creation_response
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
"Error: Module not found for tool 'create_project_issue' in category 'issues' in site 'gitlab'"

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the `create_project_issue` tool is indeed not available. Since there is no direct tool for creating an issue, I will explore the possibility of using another tool or method to achieve this task.

Let's list the tools in the "misc" category to see if there are any general tools that might help with creating an issue or interacting with the GitLab API in a more flexible way.
CODE:
# List tools in the misc category to find any general tools that might help
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='misc')

Step 13:
