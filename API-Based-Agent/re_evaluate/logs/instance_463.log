act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Increase the price of this product by 15%***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To increase the price of a product by 15%, we need to use the appropriate tool for updating product prices. Based on the list of available tools, the `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool seems to be the right choice for this task.

Next, I'll check the documentation for the `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool to understand how to use it for updating product prices.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('add_or_update_product_prices_POST', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/add_or_update_product_prices_POST.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool allows us to add or update product tier prices. It requires a list of price objects with fields such as SKU, price, price type, website ID, customer group, and quantity.

To proceed, we need to:
1. Identify the product SKU for which we want to increase the price.
2. Retrieve the current price of the product.
3. Calculate the new price by increasing the current price by 15%.
4. Use the `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool to update the product price.

Let's start by searching for the product to get its SKU and current price. I'll use the `search_products` tool to find the product details.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Assuming we need to search for a product by name or other criteria
result = call_function('search_products', site='shopping_admin', searchCriteria='name', searchValue='Product Name')
print(result)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: search_products
site: shopping_admin
parameter: searchCriteria=name, searchValue=Product Name

Traceback (most recent call last):

    result = target_function(**kwargs)
TypeError: search_products() got an unexpected keyword argument 'searchCriteria'



Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error with the parameters used for the `search_products` function. Let's check the documentation for the `search_products` tool to understand the correct parameters to use.
CODE:

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products` tool requires the following parameters:
- `field`: The product field to search on (e.g., 'name', 'sku').
- `value`: The value to search for.
- `condition_type`: The condition type for the search (default is 'eq').
- Optional parameters like `page_size`, `current_page`, `sort_by`, `sort_direction`, and `return_fields`.

Let's search for the product by its name to retrieve its SKU and current price. I'll use the correct parameters this time.

Step 10:

THOUGHT: It seems that the search did not return any products with the name "Product Name". This might be due to an incorrect product name or the product not existing in the database.

To proceed, let's try searching for products using a different approach, such as by SKU or another known attribute. If you have a specific SKU or another attribute, please let me know, or I can attempt a different search strategy.

For now, I'll attempt to search for products using a broader search criterion to see if we can retrieve any products.

Let's calculate the new price and update it.

CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 15:
act - AgentFinishAction(outputs={}, thought='Finish[Test Product]  <execute_bash> exit() </execute_bash>', action='finish')
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')
