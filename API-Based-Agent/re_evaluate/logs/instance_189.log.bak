Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Tell me the total cost of my latest pending order?***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 18:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: We have successfully retrieved your customer ID, which is `27`. Now, let's use this customer ID to search for your orders and identify the latest pending order.

I'll use the `search_orders_by_customer_admin` tool to find all orders for your customer ID and then filter for the latest pending order.

```python
# Search for all orders for the customer with ID 27
orders_result = call_function(
    'search_orders_by_customer_admin',
    site='shopping',
    customer_id=27,
    page_size=10,
    sort_by='created_at',
    sort_direction='DESC',
    return_fields=['increment_id', 'entity_id', 'status', 'total_due']
)
orders_result
```
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 19:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
