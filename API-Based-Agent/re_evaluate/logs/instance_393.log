CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Post "lgtm" for the merge request related to fixing the broken links in byteblaze/empathy-prompts project***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To post "lgtm" for the merge request related to fixing the broken links in the `byteblaze/empathy-prompts` project, I will follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the `projects` category to find the project ID for `byteblaze/empathy-prompts`.
2. Use the project ID to list merge requests in the `merge_requests` category.
3. Identify the specific merge request related to fixing broken links.
4. Post a comment with "lgtm" on the identified merge request.

Let's start by listing the tools in the `projects` category to find the project ID.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the project ID for `byteblaze/empathy-prompts`, I will use the `list_projects` tool from the `projects` category. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/projects/list_projects.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Now that we have the documentation for the `list_projects` tool, I will call this function to search for the `byteblaze/empathy-prompts` project. I'll use the `search` parameter to find the project by name.

Let's proceed with calling the function to retrieve the project ID.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Call the function to search for the project by name
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects', search='byteblaze/empathy-prompts')
projects
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

status_code: 200
content: []

[Response stored as 'response_1' - use get_response('response_1', 'search_term') to search within it]
{'status_code': 200,

 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_1',
 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search for the project `byteblaze/empathy-prompts` returned an empty list, indicating that the project might not be found with the given search criteria. I will try a broader search without specifying the full name to see if it returns any results.

Let's attempt a more general search for projects related to `byteblaze` to find the correct project.
CODE:
# Attempt a broader search for projects related to 'byteblaze'
projects_broad_search = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects', search='byteblaze')
projects_broad_search
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: list_projects
site: gitlab
category: projects
parameter: search=byteblaze

status_code: 200
content: []

[Response stored as 'response_2' - use get_response('response_2', 'search_term') to search within it]
{'status_code': 200,
 'content': [],
 'url': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects?order_by=created_at&sort=desc&search=byteblaze',
 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_2',
 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the broader search for projects related to `byteblaze` also returned an empty list. This might indicate that the project is not available or accessible with the current search criteria.

To ensure that we are not missing any details, I will try listing all projects without any search criteria to see if the project appears in the list. This will help us confirm whether the project exists or if there is an issue with the search parameters.

Let's proceed with listing all projects.
CODE:
# List all projects without any search criteria
all_projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
all_projects

 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response for listing all projects is quite large and has been truncated. To find the `byteblaze/empathy-prompts` project, I will search within the full response for any project that matches the name or path.

Let's search for the project within the full response.
CODE:
from utils import get_response

# Search for 'empathy-prompts' within the full response
search_results = get_response('response_3', 'empathy-prompts')
search_results
