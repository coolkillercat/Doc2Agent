CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Modify the address of order #125 to 654 Elm Drive, Apartment 12, Miami, FL, 33101***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To modify the address of order #125, we need to find the appropriate tool for updating an order's address. Based on the list of available tools, the `set_shipping_and_billing_addresses` tool seems relevant for setting shipping information.

Let's check the documentation for the `set_shipping_and_billing_addresses` tool to understand how to use it for updating the address of an order.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('set_shipping_and_billing_addresses', site='shopping_admin')

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `set_shipping_and_billing_addresses` tool allows us to set shipping and billing information using individual address components. It requires details such as the first name, last name, street, city, region, postcode, and optionally, the telephone and email.

To update the address for order #125, we need to provide the new address details. However, this tool does not directly specify how to associate the address update with a specific order. We might need to use another tool to first retrieve the order details and then apply the address update.

Let's first retrieve the details of order #125 to ensure we have all necessary information, such as the customer's name, which is required for the address update. We'll use the `get_order_by_id` tool for this purpose.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Retrieve order details for order #125
order_details = call_function('get_order_by_id', site='shopping_admin', order_id=125)

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response for order #125 is quite large and has been truncated. To proceed, we need to extract the customer's name and any other relevant details required for updating the address.

Let's explore the structure of the response to find the necessary information.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response contains paths for customer details, including `[customer_firstname]` and `[customer_lastname]`, which are necessary for updating the address. Let's extract these details to use them in the address update.

I'll retrieve the customer's first and last name from the response.
CODE:
from utils import get_value_at_path

# Extract customer first and last name
customer_firstname = get_value_at_path('response_1', '[customer_firstname]')
customer_lastname = get_value_at_path('response_1', '[customer_lastname]')

customer_firstname, customer_lastname

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have retrieved the customer's name: Matt Baker. Now, we can proceed to update the address for order #125 using the `set_shipping_and_billing_addresses` tool.

Let's update the address to "654 Elm Drive, Apartment 12, Miami, FL, 33101" for Matt Baker.
CODE:

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the `set_shipping_and_billing_addresses` tool is designed to work with a cart, and it cannot be used directly to update an order's address. The error message indicates that the shipping method can't be set for an empty cart.

To update the address for an existing order, we might need a different approach or tool. Let's explore the available tools again to see if there is a specific tool for updating an order's address directly.

I'll search for any tool related to updating order details or addresses.
