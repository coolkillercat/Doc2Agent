CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Set my gitlab status as Busy.***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To set your GitLab status as "Busy," we need to interact with the GitLab API using the appropriate tools. Let's start by listing the available tools in the "users" category, as this is likely where user status updates would be managed.

I'll begin by listing the tools in the "users" category to find the appropriate function for updating the user status.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
# List available tools in the 'users' category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'
DEBUG: Looking for GitLab subdirectory tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/tool_description.json
DEBUG: File exists: True
DEBUG: Successfully read tool_description.json for users
"Available tools in GitLab users:\n- approve_user: Approves a pending user account.\n- get_user_ssh_key: Retrieves a specific SSH key for a given GitLab user.\n- list_user_ssh_keys: Retrieves all SSH keys associated with a specific user, identified by either their user ID or username.\n- ban_user: Bans a specified user from the GitLab instance.\n- create_service_account: Creates a service account user for automated processes or integrations.\n- list_user_emails: Retrieves a list of all email addresses associated with the authenticated user's account, showing each email's ID, address, and confirmation status.\n- get_user_gpg_keys: Retrieves all GPG keys associated with a specific GitLab user.\n- disable_user_two_factor_authentication: Disables two-factor authentication (2FA) for a specified user.\n- get_user_preferences: Retrieves the authenticated user's preferences including settings for viewing diffs, showing whitespace, and passing identities to CI JWT.\n- get_user_contribution_events: Retrieves contribution events for a specified GitLab user within an optional date range.\n- list_ssh_keys: Retrieves a list of the authenticated user's SSH keys with optional pagination.\n- get_user_counts: Retrieves counts of assigned issues, merge requests, review requests, and todos for the authenticated user.\n- set_user_status: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_user_status: Retrieves the current status of a GitLab user including their emoji, availability, message, and clear status time.\n- update_user_preferences: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- list_group_users: Retrieves a list of users associated with a specific group, including options to filter for SAML users or service accounts.\n- deactivate_user: Deactivates a specified user in the GitLab system.\n- create_personal_access_token: Creates a new personal access token for the currently authenticated user with k8s_proxy scope.\n- get_user: Retrieves detailed information about a specific user by their ID.\n- reject_user: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_ssh_key: Retrieve details of a specific SSH key associated with the user account.\n- get_current_user: Retrieves information about the currently authenticated user.\n- unfollow_user: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- list_provisioned_users: Retrieves a list of users provisioned by a specific group.\n- unban_user: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_user_following: Retrieve a list of users who the specified GitLab user is following.\n- get_user_gpg_key: Retrieves a specific GPG key for the authenticated user by its ID.\n- activate_user: Activates a specified user in the GitLab system.\n- add_ssh_key: Creates a new SSH key for the authenticated user with specified title, key content, optional expiration date, and usage scope (authentication, signing, or both).\n- get_user_associations_count: Retrieves counts of a user's associated projects, groups, issues, and merge requests.\n- revoke_impersonation_token: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- add_email: Creates a new email address for the authenticated user's account, enabling them to receive notifications and communications to this additional email.\n- get_email_details: Retrieves details of a specific email including the email address and confirmation timestamp.\n- list_users: Retrieves a list of GitLab users with comprehensive filtering options including by username, activity status, creation date, and user type.\n- get_user_followers: Retrieve a list of users who are following the specified GitLab user."

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool `set_user_status` seems to be the one we need to use to update the GitLab status. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it to set the status to "Busy."

I'll retrieve the documentation for the `set_user_status` tool.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
# Get documentation for the 'set_user_status' tool
get_documentation('set_user_status', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/set_user_status.py
'"""\nSets or updates the current user\'s status with custom emoji, message, and optional auto-clear timing. Allows choosing between PUT (replace entire status) or PATCH (update only specified fields).\n\n    Args:\n        emoji (str): Name of the emoji to use as status.

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `set_user_status` tool allows us to set or update the current user's status with a custom message. We can use the `PATCH` method to update only the specified fields, such as the status message.

Let's proceed to call the `set_user_status` function to set your GitLab status as "Busy."
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Call the function to set the GitLab status to "Busy"
response = call_function('set_user_status', site='gitlab', category='users', message='Busy', method='PATCH')
response
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

site: gitlab
category: users
parameter: message=Busy, method=PATCH
url: http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/user/status
status_code: 404
content: {
  "error": "404 Not Found"
}

[Response stored as 'response_1' - use get_response('response_1', 'search_term') to search within it]
{'status_code': 404,
 'content': {'error': '404 Not Found'},
 'url': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/user/status',
 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_1',
 '_original_response': <Response [404]>}

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API call to set the user status returned a 404 Not Found error. This could be due to an incorrect endpoint or missing permissions. Let's verify the endpoint and ensure that the correct API path is being used.

I'll check the stored response to see if there are any additional details or clues about the error.
CODE:
from utils import get_response
# Retrieve the full response to check for additional details
full_response = get_response('response_1')
full_response
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
'Full response for response_1:\n{\n  "error": "404 Not Found"\n}'

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The 404 Not Found error indicates that the endpoint might not be correct or accessible. Let's verify the available tools again to ensure we are using the correct function and endpoint for setting the user status.

I'll recheck the list of tools in the "users" category to confirm the correct tool for setting the user status.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
# Re-list available tools in the 'users' category to verify the correct tool
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool `set_user_status` is indeed listed, but the previous attempt to use it resulted in a 404 error. This suggests there might be an issue with the endpoint or permissions.

Let's try using the `get_current_user` tool to verify the current user's information and ensure that the API is accessible. This will help us confirm that the API is functioning correctly for user-related queries.

I'll retrieve the current user's information using the `get_current_user` tool.
