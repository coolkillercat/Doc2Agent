CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Draft a new marketing price rule for spring sale that offers a 20 percent discount site-wide for all customers***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To create a new marketing price rule for a spring sale offering a 20% discount site-wide, we need to identify the appropriate tool from the list. The tool should allow us to create or update a price rule. 

From the list of available tools, none explicitly mention creating or updating price rules directly. However, tools related to product pricing or promotions might be relevant. Let's check the documentation for the `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool to see if it can be used for this purpose.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('add_or_update_product_prices_POST', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/add_or_update_product_prices_POST.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool is used to add or update product tier prices, but it doesn't seem to directly support creating a site-wide discount rule. It focuses on individual product pricing adjustments.

Since the tool doesn't meet our needs for creating a marketing price rule, let's explore other possibilities. We should look for a tool that might handle promotions or discounts more broadly.

I'll check the documentation for the `replace_product_tier_prices_PUT` tool to see if it offers any relevant functionality for creating a site-wide discount.
CODE:
get_documentation('replace_product_tier_prices_PUT', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/replace_product_tier_prices_PUT.py
'"""\nReplace existing tier prices and replace them with new ones.\n    \n    Args:\n        prices (list): List of price objects with the following structure:\n            [\n                {\n                    "sku": "product_sku",\n                    "price": 10.99,\n                    "price_type": "fixed", # or "discount"\n                    "website_id": 0,\n                    "customer_group": "ALL GROUPS",\n                    "quantity": 1\n                }\n            ]\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns an empty array after replacing a product\'s tier prices with new pricing information.\n    Example:\n        prices = [\n            {\n                "sku": "24-MB01",\n                "price": 10.99,\n                "price_type": "fixed",\n                "website_id": 0,\n                "customer_group": "ALL GROUPS",\n                "quantity": 1\n            }\n        ]\n        response = replace_product_tier_prices(prices)\n""" example: replace_product_tier_prices()'

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `replace_product_tier_prices_PUT` tool is also focused on replacing tier prices for individual products, similar to the `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool. It doesn't directly support creating a site-wide discount rule.

Since neither of these tools is suitable for creating a marketing price rule, we need to consider other options. It's possible that the tool for creating marketing price rules is not explicitly named in the list, or it might be part of a broader tool related to promotions or discounts.

Let's try searching for any tool related to promotions or discounts by looking for keywords like "promotion" or "discount" in the tool list. This might help us identify the correct tool to use.
CODE:
# Searching for tools related to promotions or discounts
promotion_tools = [tool for tool in list_tools(site='shopping_admin') if 'promotion' in tool or 'discount' in tool]
promotion_tools
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'shopping_admin'
DEBUG: Looking for tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tool_descriptions.json
DEBUG: File exists: True
DEBUG: Successfully read tool_descriptions.json
[]

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there are no tools explicitly related to "promotion" or "discount" in the tool list. This suggests that the functionality for creating a marketing price rule might be part of a broader tool or not explicitly named.

Given this situation, let's try a different approach. We can explore the possibility of using a tool related to creating or managing rules or configurations that might implicitly support creating a marketing price rule.

I'll check the documentation for the `create_filter_condition` tool to see if it might be relevant for setting up conditions for a marketing price rule.
CODE:
get_documentation('create_filter_condition', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/create_filter_condition.py
'"""\nCreates a search filter for the Magento REST API.\n    \n    Args:\n        field (str): The field to filter on\n        value (str): The value to filter by\n        condition_type (str, optional): The condition type (eq, like, gt, lt, etc). Defaults to \'eq\'.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns order information including financial details, customer data, shipping information, and order status.\n""" example: create_filter_condition(\'status\', \'pending\')'

Step 10:
act - AgentFinishAction(outputs={}, thought='The `create_filter_condition` tool is designed to create search filters for the Magento REST API, which is not directly related to creating a marketing price rule or discount.\n\nSince none of the tools explicitly support creating a marketing price rule, and given the constraints of the available tools, it seems that the functionality for creating a marketing price rule might not be directly exposed through the current API tools.\n\nIn this case, the best approach would be to use the available tools to adjust product prices individually or in bulk, as a workaround to achieve a similar effect to a site-wide discount. However, this would not be as efficient or straightforward as using a dedicated marketing price rule tool.\n\nGiven the limitations, I will conclude that the specific task of drafting a new marketing price rule for a spring sale offering a 20% discount site-wide cannot be directly accomplished with the current set of API tools provided.\n\nFinish[The specific task of drafting a new marketing price rule for a spring sale offering a 20% discount site-wide cannot be directly accomplished with the current set of API tools provided.]', action='finish')
