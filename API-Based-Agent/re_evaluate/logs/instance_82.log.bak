Step 10:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to find the fastest route between coordinates. It requires the following parameters:

- `coordinates`: A string of coordinates in the format `{longitude},{latitude};{longitude},{latitude}`.
- `profile`: Mode of transportation, which can be `'5000'` for car, `'5001'` for bicycle, or `'5002'` for foot.

To calculate the travel durations, we need to:

1. Get the walking duration from MIT to Harvard University using the `profile` for foot (`'5002'`).
2. Get the driving duration from Harvard University to Boston Logan International Airport using the `profile` for car (`'5000'`).

Let's start by calculating the walking duration from MIT to Harvard University. I'll use the coordinates for these locations:

- MIT: 42.3601° N, 71.0942° W
- Harvard University: 42.3770° N, 71.1167° W

I'll call the `route_service_GET` tool for this calculation.
