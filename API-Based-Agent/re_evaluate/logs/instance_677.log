Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Lookup orders that are processing***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find orders that are processing, I will use the `search_orders_by_status` tool, which is specifically designed to search for orders with a specific status. Let's first check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.

I'll proceed by retrieving the documentation for the `search_orders_by_status` tool:
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_orders_by_status', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_orders_by_status.py
'"""\nSearches for orders with a specific status (e.g., \'pending\', \'processing\', \'complete\'), with support for pagination and sorting.\n    \n    Args:\n        status (str): Order status to filter by (e.g., \'pending\', \'processing\', \'complete\')\n        page_size (int, optional): Maximum number of items to return per page\n        current_page (int, optional): Current page number for pagination\n        sort_by (str, optional): Field to sort results by (e.g., \'created_at\', \'increment_id\')\n        sort_direction (str, optional): Sort direction, either \'ASC\' or \'DESC\'\n        return_fields (list, optional): List of fields to return in the response\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of orders filtered by status, including customer email and order identification details.\n""" example: search_orders_by_status(\'pending\', page_size=10, sort_by=\'created_at\', return_fields=[\'increment_id\', \'entity_id\', \'customer_email\'])'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_status` tool allows us to search for orders with a specific status, such as 'processing'. It supports pagination, sorting, and allows specifying which fields to return.

To find orders that are processing, I'll call this function with the status set to 'processing'. I'll also specify a reasonable page size and request some key fields like order ID and customer email.

Let's proceed with calling the function to search for processing orders:
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Call the function to search for orders with 'processing' status
response = call_function(
    'search_orders_by_status',
    site='shopping_admin',
    status='processing',
    page_size=10,
    sort_by='created_at',
    return_fields=['increment_id', 'entity_id', 'customer_email']
)
