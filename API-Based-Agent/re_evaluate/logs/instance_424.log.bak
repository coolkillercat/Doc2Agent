CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to wikipedia and map. Answer the question: ***Find the page of the place where Mr. Rogers was filmed on the map.***
The site URL for wikipedia is http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8888, use this instead of the normal wikipedia URL. 
The site URL for map is http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000, use this instead of the normal map URL. 

For the map website, you will be provided with three sets of APIs, each providing different functionalities; 
For the wikipedia website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. get_documentation(tool_name, site='wikipedia') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
2. call_function(tool_name, site='wikipedia', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
3. call_direct(method, url, headers, body, site='wikipedia') - For custom API calls

**AVAILABLE TOOLS:**
Available tools:
- get_available_categories: Retrieves the list of all content categories available in the ZIM file library as an OPDS Navigation Feed
- get_available_languages: Retrieves the list of all languages available in the ZIM file library as an OPDS Navigation Feed
- get_catalog_root: Retrieves the OPDS Catalog Root that links to all OPDS acquisition and navigation feeds available through the API
- get_content: Retrieves specific content from a ZIM file, with optional path parameter (empty path returns main page)
- get_entry_details: Retrieves full metadata information about a specific ZIM file identified by its UUID
- get_entry_illustration: Retrieves the illustration/cover image of specified size for a ZIM file identified by its UUID
- get_library_entries: Retrieves a complete list or filtered subset of ZIM files in the library as a paginated OPDS acquisition feed
- get_metadata: Retrieves a specific metadata item from a ZIM file, providing access to embedded metadata information
- get_partial_library_entries: Retrieves a list of ZIM files with partial entry information, useful for displaying compact library listings
- get_random_article: Retrieves a randomly selected article from the specified ZIM file, useful for exploration features
- get_raw_content: Retrieves raw content from a ZIM file without any server-side processing, ensuring original data is preserved
- get_suggestions: Retrieves title suggestions for partially typed search queries against a specific ZIM file, supporting autocomplete functionality
- search_geospatial: Performs a geospatial search to find content within a specified distance of geographical coordinates
- search_library: Performs a full text search across specified ZIM files and returns results with snippets of matching content

Step 14:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The search results provide links to various seasons of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood." To find the filming location, we need to look for specific information about where the show was filmed. Typically, this information might be found in the main article about the show.

Let's search within the full response for any mention of the filming location or studio used for "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood." I'll proceed with this search now.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 15:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 16:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Let's search within the full response for any mention of the filming location or studio used for "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood." I'll search for terms like "filmed," "studio," or "location" to find relevant information.
CODE:
# Search for filming location details in the full response
filming_location_info = get_response('response_1', 'filmed')
filming_location_info
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
"No matches found for 'filmed' in response_1"

Step 17:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Since the search for "filmed" did not yield results, let's try searching for other related terms like "studio" or "location" to find the filming location of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood."
CODE:
# Search for studio or location details in the full response
studio_info = get_response('response_1', 'studio')
location_info = get_response('response_1', 'location')
(studio_info, location_info)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
("No matches found for 'studio' in response_1",
 "No matches found for 'location' in response_1")

Step 18:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: Since the search within the response did not yield any results for the filming location, let's try a different approach. We can use the map API to search for "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" and see if it provides any location details.

I'll start by listing the available tools for the map site to find the appropriate API for searching locations.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 19:

Step 22:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Let's use the `search_GET` tool to search for "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API. I'll perform a search with a free-form query to find any location details related to the show.
CODE:
# Perform a search for "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" using the map API
search_results_map = call_function('search_GET', site='map', q="Mister Rogers' Neighborhood", format='json', limit=5, addressdetails=1)
search_results_map
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: search_GET
site: map
parameter: q=Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, format=json, limit=5, addressdetails=1
api_url: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search
url: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=Mister+Rogers%27+Neighborhood&format=json&limit=5&addressdetails=1&dedupe=1
status_code: 200
content: []

[Response stored as 'response_2' - use get_response('response_2', 'search_term') to search within it]
{'status_code': 200,
 'content': [],
 'url': 'https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=Mister+Rogers%27+Neighborhood&format=json&limit=5&addressdetails=1&dedupe=1',
 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_2',
 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 23:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: It seems that the search for "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" did not return any results from the map API. This might be because the show is not directly associated with a specific location name in the map database.

However, the filming location for "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" is known to be WQED Studios in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Let's search for this location on the map to find its details.

I'll perform a search for "WQED Studios, Pittsburgh" using the map API.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 24:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')
