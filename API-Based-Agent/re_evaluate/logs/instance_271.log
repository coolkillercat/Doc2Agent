Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Show me products under $46.99 in "makeup remover" category***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find products under $46.99 in the "makeup remover" category, the most relevant tools are likely `search_products_by_category_admin` and `search_products_by_price_range_admin`. 

Let's start by checking the documentation for `search_products_by_category_admin` to understand how to use it for finding products in the "makeup remover" category.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_category_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_products_by_category_admin.py

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_category_admin` tool allows us to find products belonging to a specific category using the category ID. We need to find the category ID for "makeup remover" to use this tool effectively.

Next, let's check the documentation for `search_products_by_price_range_admin` to understand how to filter products by price.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_price_range_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_price_range_admin` tool allows us to search for products within a specified price range. We can use this tool to filter products under $46.99.

To proceed, we need to:
1. Find the category ID for "makeup remover".
2. Use the `search_products_by_category_admin` tool to find products in the "makeup remover" category.
3. Use the `search_products_by_price_range_admin` tool to filter those products by price.

Let's start by finding the category ID for "makeup remover". We might need to use a tool that lists categories or search for products by name to identify the category ID. Let's check if there's a tool for listing categories.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_name_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_products_by_name_admin.py

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name_admin` tool allows us to search for products by name using a pattern. We can use this tool to search for products with "makeup remover" in their name, which might help us identify the category ID.

Let's proceed by searching for products with "makeup remover" in their name to gather more information.
