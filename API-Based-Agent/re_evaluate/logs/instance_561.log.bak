CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Create a repo named bafta_awards_nolan with movies that are nominated BAFTA Awards by Christopher Nolan in a README file***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='category') - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list tools in multiple categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To create a repository named `bafta_awards_nolan` with a README file containing movies nominated for BAFTA Awards by Christopher Nolan, I'll follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the `projects` category to find tools for creating a new project.
2. Get documentation for the tool that allows creating a new project.
3. Call the function to create the repository.
4. List available tools in the `repository_files` category to find tools for creating or updating files.
5. Get documentation for the tool that allows creating or updating a README file.
6. Call the function to create the README file with the required content.

Let's start by listing the tools in the `projects` category.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool we need to create a new project is `create_project`. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('create_project', site='gitlab', category='projects')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_project` tool allows us to create a new GitLab project with various customizable settings. For our task, we need to create a project named `bafta_awards_nolan` and initialize it with a README file. Here's how we'll proceed:

1. Set the `name` parameter to "bafta_awards_nolan".
2. Set `initialize_with_readme` to `True` to create the project with a README file.
3. Optionally, set the `description` to provide context about the project.

Let's create the project now.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Create the project with the specified parameters
project_creation_response = call_function(
    'create_project',
    site='gitlab',

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The project `bafta_awards_nolan` has been successfully created with a README file. Now, we need to update the README file with the list of movies nominated for BAFTA Awards by Christopher Nolan.

Next, I'll list the tools in the `repository_files` category to find the appropriate tool for updating the README file.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the available tools in the `repository_files` category do not include a direct method for creating or updating files. However, typically, the `create_file` or `update_file` functionality would be used for such tasks. Since these tools are not listed, it might be necessary to explore other categories or assume a different approach.

Let's try listing tools in the `repositories` category to see if there are any relevant tools for file creation or updates.

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_repository_file` tool is what we need to create a new file in the repository. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters for creating or updating the README file with the list of movies.

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_repository_file` tool allows us to create a new file in the repository with specified content. We will use this tool to create or update the `README.md` file in the `bafta_awards_nolan` repository with the list of movies nominated for BAFTA Awards by Christopher Nolan.

Here are the steps:
1. Use the `project_id` obtained from the project creation response.
2. Set `file_path` to "README.md".
3. Provide the `content` with the list of movies.
4. Use the `branch` as "main".
5. Set a `commit_message` like "Add BAFTA nominated movies by Christopher Nolan".

Let's proceed with creating the README file.

THOUGHT: The error message indicates that a file named `README.md` already exists in the repository. To update the existing file, we should use the `update_repository_file` tool instead of `create_repository_file`.
