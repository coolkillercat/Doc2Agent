CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***set the homepage URL on my GitLab profile to https://egg.tart.com***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To set the homepage URL on your GitLab profile, we need to interact with the GitLab API to update the user profile information. Let's follow the steps to achieve this:

1. **List available tools in the 'users' category** to find the appropriate tool for updating user profile information.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To update the homepage URL on your GitLab profile, we need to find a tool that allows us to update user information. From the list of available tools, it seems we need to look for a tool that can update user preferences or profile details.

Let's check the documentation for the `update_user_preferences` tool to see if it allows updating the homepage URL.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
# Get documentation for the 'update_user_preferences' tool
get_documentation('update_user_preferences', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/update_user_preferences.py
'"""\nUpdates the current user\'s preferences for viewing diffs and handling CI authentication. Returns the updated user preference settings.\n\n    Args:\n        view_diffs_file_by_file (bool): Flag indicating the user sees only one file diff per page.\n        show_whitespace_in_diffs (bool): Flag indicating the user sees whitespace changes in diffs.\n        pass_user_identities_to_ci_jwt (bool): Flag indicating the user passes their external identities as CI information.\n\n    Returns:\n        Returns the updated user preferences for viewing diffs and handling CI authentication.\n""" example: update_user_preferences(view_diffs_file_by_file=True, show_whitespace_in_diffs=False, pass_user_identities_to_ci_jwt=False)'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `update_user_preferences` tool does not seem to support updating the homepage URL. We need to find another tool that allows us to update user profile information, specifically the homepage URL.

Let's check the documentation for the `get_current_user` tool to see if it provides information about the current user, which might include the homepage URL, and then look for a tool that can update this information.
CODE:
# Get documentation for the 'get_current_user' tool
get_documentation('get_current_user', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/get_current_user.py
'"""\nRetrieves information about the currently authenticated user. Administrators can optionally retrieve information for a specific user by providing their ID in the sudo parameter.\n    \n    Args:\n        sudo_id (int, optional): ID of a user to make the call in their place. Defaults to None.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns detailed profile information about the currently authenticated user, including personal details, account settings, and activity statistics.\n""" example: get_current_user()'

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_current_user` tool retrieves detailed profile information about the currently authenticated user, which might include the homepage URL. However, it does not allow us to update the homepage URL.

Since we haven't found a tool specifically for updating the homepage URL, let's check the documentation for the `get_user` tool to see if it provides any additional information or options for updating user details.
CODE:
# Get documentation for the 'get_user' tool
get_documentation('get_user', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/get_user.py
'"""\nRetrieves detailed information about a specific user by their ID. This function allows fetching comprehensive user profile data, with an option to include custom attributes.\n    \n    Args:\n        user_id: The ID of the user to retrieve information for\n        include_custom_attributes: Whether to include custom attributes in the response\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns detailed profile information for a specific user including personal details, social media links, activity metrics, and optional custom attributes.\n""" example: get_user(user_id=2330, include_custom_attributes=True)'

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_user` tool retrieves detailed information about a specific user by their ID, but it does not provide a way to update user information.

Since none of the tools we've explored so far allow us to update the homepage URL directly, let's try listing all tools in the 'users' category again to ensure we haven't missed any tool that might allow updating user profile information.

THOUGHT: It seems that none of the tools explicitly allow updating the homepage URL. However, there might be a tool that allows updating user profile information that we haven't identified yet.

Let's try listing tools in the 'users' category again to ensure we haven't missed any tool that might allow updating user profile information. This time, let's focus on any tool that might have been overlooked or misinterpreted.
CODE:
# List tools in the 'users' category again to ensure we haven't missed any tool
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='users')
