Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Lookup orders that are canceled***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find orders that are canceled, I will use the `search_orders_by_status` tool, which allows searching for orders with a specific status. Let's first check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_orders_by_status', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_orders_by_status.py
'"""\nSearches for orders with a specific status (e.g., \'pending\', \'processing\', \'complete\'), with support for pagination and sorting.\n    \n    Args:\n        status (str): Order status to filter by (e.g., \'pending\', \'processing\', \'complete\')\n        page_size (int, optional): Maximum number of items to return per page\n        current_page (int, optional): Current page number for pagination\n        sort_by (str, optional): Field to sort results by (e.g., \'created_at\', \'increment_id\')\n        sort_direction (str, optional): Sort direction, either \'ASC\' or \'DESC\'\n        return_fields (list, optional): List of fields to return in the response\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of orders filtered by status, including customer email and order identification details.\n""" example: search_orders_by_status(\'pending\', page_size=10, sort_by=\'created_at\', return_fields=[\'increment_id\', \'entity_id\', \'customer_email\'])'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_status` tool allows us to search for orders with a specific status, such as 'pending', 'processing', or 'complete'. It supports pagination and sorting, and we can specify which fields to return in the response.

To find canceled orders, I'll call this tool with the status set to 'canceled'. Let's proceed with that.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
result = call_function('search_orders_by_status', site='shopping_admin', status='canceled', page_size=10, sort_by='created_at', return_fields=['increment_id', 'entity_id', 'customer_email'])

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response contains a list of canceled orders, but it was truncated. I'll retrieve the full response to ensure we have all the necessary details about the canceled orders.

Let's explore the full response to see all the available data paths and extract the relevant information.
CODE:
from utils import list_all_paths, get_value_at_path

# List all available JSON paths in the response
list_all_paths('response_1')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
"Available paths in response_1 (depth ≤ 10):\n  [items]\n  [items][0]\n  [items][0][customer_email]\n  [items][0][entity_id]\n  [items][0][increment_id]\n  [items][1]\n  [items][1][customer_email]\n  [items][1][entity_id]\n  [items][1][increment_id]\n  [items][2]\n  [items][2][customer_email]\n  [items][2][entity_id]\n  [items][2][increment_id]\n  [items][3]\n  [items][3][customer_email]\n  [items][3][entity_id]\n  [items][3][increment_id]\n  [items][4]\n  [items][4][customer_email]\n  [items][4][entity_id]\n  [items][4][increment_id]\n  [items][...] (5 more items, indices 5 to 9)\n\nFor arrays, you can access any index directly with get_value_at_path(), even if not shown above.\nExample: get_value_at_path('response_1', '[items][42][name]') will work if item 42 exists."

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Now that we have the paths, I'll extract the relevant information about the canceled orders, including the customer email, entity ID, and increment ID for each order.

Let's retrieve and display this information.
CODE:
from utils import get_response

# Retrieve the full response data
full_data = get_response('response_1')

# Extract and display the relevant information about canceled orders
canceled_orders = []
for item in full_data['items']:

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with accessing the data. The response might be in a string format instead of a dictionary. I'll convert the response content to a dictionary and then extract the information again.

Let's correct this and extract the canceled orders information.

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error in handling the response data. Let's try accessing the response content correctly using the `get_response` function to ensure we have the data in the right format.

I'll retrieve the response content again and extract the canceled orders information.

Step 12:

Let's try this approach again.

THOUGHT: It seems there is a persistent issue with parsing the response content. Let's try a different approach to ensure we are accessing the response data correctly. I'll use the `get_response` function to retrieve the response as a dictionary directly.

Let's attempt to access the response data again.
CODE:
# Retrieve the full response data as a dictionary
full_data_dict = get_response('response_1')

# Extract and display the relevant information about canceled orders
canceled_orders = []
for item in full_data_dict['items']:
    canceled_orders.append({
        'customer_email': item['customer_email'],
        'entity_id': item['entity_id'],
        'increment_id': item['increment_id']
    })

     13 canceled_orders

TypeError: string indices must be integers

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is a misunderstanding in how the response is being accessed. Let's ensure that we are correctly handling the response as a JSON object. I'll use the `get_response` function to retrieve the response content and then parse it correctly.

Let's try this approach once more.
CODE:
# Retrieve the full response data as a dictionary
full_data_dict = get_response('response_1')

# Check the type of the response to ensure it's a dictionary
type(full_data_dict)
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
str

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response is being retrieved as a string, which is causing the issues when trying to access it as a dictionary. Let's convert the string response to a JSON object properly.

I'll parse the response string into a JSON object and then extract the canceled orders information.
CODE:
import json

# Retrieve the full response data as a string
response_content = get_response('response_1')

# Parse the response content as JSON
full_data_dict = json.loads(response_content)

# Extract and display the relevant information about canceled orders
canceled_orders = []
for item in full_data_dict['items']:
    canceled_orders.append({
        'customer_email': item['customer_email'],
