CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***How many reviews our shop received in Apr 2023?***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: To find out how many reviews the shop received in April 2023, I need to identify the appropriate tool for retrieving review data. Based on the list of available tools, it seems there isn't a direct tool specifically named for retrieving reviews. However, I will look for any tool related to reviews or feedback.

Since the list is extensive, I'll search for any tool that might be related to reviews or feedback. If none are found, I may need to explore related tools or consider alternative approaches.

Let's start by checking the documentation for any tool that might be related to reviews or feedback. I'll search for keywords like "review" or "feedback" in the tool names.
CODE:

THOUGHT: It seems that none of the tools directly relate to retrieving reviews. Since there isn't a direct tool for reviews in the list, I need to consider alternative approaches.

Given the available tools, I will now search for any tool that might be related to retrieving reviews or feedback for products or the shop as a whole. I'll look for any tool that might have been overlooked in the initial list.

Let's search for any tool that might be related to retrieving reviews or feedback by checking the documentation for any tool that might be related to reviews.
