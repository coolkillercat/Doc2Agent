CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Assign the issue regarding flash alert in primer design guide repo to myself.***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: To proceed, I will use the `list_projects` tool to find the project ID for the "primer design guide" repository. Once I have the project ID, I can then look for the specific issue regarding the flash alert.

Let's get the documentation for the `list_projects` tool to understand how to use it.

Step 7:

THOUGHT: Now that I have the documentation for the `update_issue` tool, I will use it to assign the issue with ID 83787 to myself. I will need to specify the `project_id`, `issue_iid`, and my user ID in the `assignee_ids` parameter.

First, I need to find my user ID. Let's list the tools in the 'users' category to find a tool that can help me retrieve my user ID.
CODE:
# List tools in the 'users' category to find user-related tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='users')

Step 14:

THOUGHT: To find my user ID, I will use the `get_current_user` tool, which retrieves information about the currently authenticated user. This will provide me with the necessary user ID to assign the issue to myself.

Let's call the `get_current_user` function to retrieve my user ID.
CODE:
# Call the function to get information about the currently authenticated user
current_user = call_function('get_current_user', site='gitlab', category='users')
