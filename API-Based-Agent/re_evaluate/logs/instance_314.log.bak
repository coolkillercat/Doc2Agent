CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***List the name of the top 3 contributors to primer/design repo, ranked by the number of commits?***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To find the top 3 contributors to the `primer/design` repository on GitLab, ranked by the number of commits, we need to follow these steps:

1. List the available tools in the `projects` category to find the project ID for the `primer/design` repository.
2. Use the project ID to list the available tools in the `commits` category to find the contributors and their commit counts.
3. Retrieve and rank the contributors by the number of commits.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: To find the project ID for the `primer/design` repository, we need to use the `list_projects` tool from the `projects` category. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_projects` tool allows us to retrieve a list of GitLab projects with various filtering options. To find the `primer/design` repository, we can use the `search` parameter to look for projects matching the name "primer/design".

Let's call the `list_projects` function with the appropriate parameters to find the project ID for `primer/design`.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

Next, we need to list the available tools in the `commits` category to find the contributors and their commit counts. Let's proceed with that.

Step 10:

THOUGHT: To retrieve the list of contributors and their commit counts, we can use the `list_repository_commits` tool from the `commits` category. This tool will allow us to get a list of commits from the repository, which we can then analyze to determine the top contributors.

Step 13:

THOUGHT: It seems there was an error in decoding the JSON response. This might be due to the response being stored in a different format. Let's first print the full response to understand its structure and then proceed with processing it correctly.
CODE:
# Print the full response to understand its structure
full_commits_data = get_response('response_3')
print(full_commits_data[:1000])  # Print the first 1000 characters to inspect the structure
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
Full response for response_3:

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The full response is a list of dictionaries, each representing a commit. Let's process this data to count the number of commits by each author and determine the top 3 contributors.

I'll proceed with processing the data correctly this time.
CODE:
from collections import Counter
import ast

# Convert the string representation of the list to an actual list
commits_list = ast.literal_eval(full_commits_data)

# Count the number of commits by each author
author_commit_counts = Counter(commit['author_name'] for commit in commits_list)

# Get the top 3 contributors by number of commits
top_contributors = author_commit_counts.most_common(3)

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error in processing the response due to the way it was printed. Let's try a different approach by directly parsing the response content without using `ast.literal_eval`.

I'll extract the commit data and count the number of commits by each author to find the top contributors.
CODE:

commits_list = json.loads(full_commits_data.replace("'", "\""))

    356 return obj, end

JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Step 16:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is an issue with the format of the response. Let's try a different approach by manually parsing the response using Python's `ast` module to safely evaluate the string representation of the list.

I'll proceed with this approach to extract the commit data and determine the top contributors.
CODE:

# Safely evaluate the string representation of the list
commits_list = ast.literal_eval(full_commits_data)

# Count the number of commits by each author

    Full response for response_3:

Step 17:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems the response content is not directly usable with `ast.literal_eval` due to the way it was printed. Let's try a different approach by extracting the relevant part of the response and processing it.

I'll extract the commit data from the response and count the number of commits by each author to find the top contributors.
CODE:
# Extract the relevant part of the response manually
start_index = full_commits_data.find("[{")
end_index = full_commits_data.rfind("}]") + 2
commits_data_str = full_commits_data[start_index:end_index]

# Safely evaluate the string representation of the list
commits_list = ast.literal_eval(commits_data_str)

# Count the number of commits by each author
author_commit_counts = Counter(commit['author_name'] for commit in commits_list)

# Get the top 3 contributors by number of commits
top_contributors = author_commit_counts.most_common(3)
