act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Buy the highest rated product from the Ceiling light category within a budget above 1000.***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

THOUGHT: To accomplish the task of buying the highest-rated product from the Ceiling light category within a budget above 1000, I'll follow these steps:

1. List available tools to understand what functions are available for interacting with the shopping site.
2. Use the appropriate tool to search for products in the Ceiling light category.
3. Filter the products to find the highest-rated one within the specified budget.
4. Add the selected product to the shopping cart.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: To proceed with buying the highest-rated product from the Ceiling light category within a budget above 1000, I'll follow these steps:

1. Use the `search_products_by_category_admin` tool to find products in the Ceiling light category.
2. Filter these products to find the highest-rated one within the specified budget.
3. Add the selected product to the shopping cart using the appropriate tool.
4. Complete the purchase.

Let's start by checking the documentation for the `search_products_by_category_admin` tool to understand how to use it for finding products in the Ceiling light category.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_category_admin', site='shopping')

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_category_admin` tool allows us to find all products belonging to a specific category by using the category ID. We can also specify pagination and sorting options.

Next, I'll use this tool to search for products in the Ceiling light category. However, I need to know the category ID for Ceiling lights. I'll assume we have a way to find this ID, or I'll proceed with a hypothetical ID for demonstration purposes.

Let's proceed with searching for products in the Ceiling light category using a hypothetical category ID of '123'. I'll also sort the results by rating in descending order to find the highest-rated product.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Hypothetical category ID for Ceiling lights
category_id = '123'

# Search for products in the Ceiling light category, sorted by rating in descending order
result = call_function('search_products_by_category_admin', site='shopping',
                       category_id=category_id,
                       page_size=10,
                       current_page=1,
                       sort_by='rating',

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an internal error when trying to search for products in the Ceiling light category. This could be due to an incorrect category ID or an issue with the server.

To proceed, I'll try a different approach by using the `search_products_by_name_admin` tool to search for products with "Ceiling light" in their name. This way, we can still find relevant products without relying on the category ID.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_products_by_name_admin` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_name_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name_admin` tool allows us to search for products by matching a specific pattern in their names using SQL LIKE syntax. We can specify pagination, sorting, and the fields to return.

I'll use this tool to search for products with "Ceiling light" in their name, sort them by rating in descending order, and retrieve relevant fields such as name, SKU, price, and rating.

Let's proceed with this search.
CODE:
