Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Give me the SKU of the products that have 1-3 units left***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the SKU of products with 1-3 units left, I need to identify the appropriate tool for retrieving product inventory information. Based on the available tools, the `get_low_stock_items_GET` tool seems relevant for retrieving products with low inventory. I'll check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('get_low_stock_items_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/get_low_stock_items_GET.py
'"""\nRetrieves a list of SKU\'s with low inventory quantity.\n    \n    Args:\n        scopeId (int): The scope ID (required).\n        qty (float): The quantity threshold for low stock (required).\n        currentPage (int, optional): The current page number. Defaults to 1.\n        pageSize (int, optional): The number of items per page. Defaults to 20.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of SKUs with inventory quantities below a specified threshold.\n    Examples:\n        >>> response = get_low_stock_items(scopeId=1, qty=10)\n        >>> response = get_low_stock_items(scopeId=1, qty=10, currentPage=2, pageSize=50)\n""" example: get_low_stock_items(scopeId=1, qty=10, currentPage=1, pageSize=20)'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_low_stock_items_GET` tool retrieves a list of SKUs with inventory quantities below a specified threshold. To find products with 1-3 units left, I'll call this function with a `qty` parameter set to 3. I'll also specify the `scopeId` as 1, which is typically used for default stock scope, and use default pagination settings.

Let's proceed with calling this function to get the desired SKUs.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
response = call_function('get_low_stock_items_GET', site='shopping_admin', scopeId=1, qty=3, currentPage=1, pageSize=20)

 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_1',
 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 8:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The response indicates that there are no products with 1-3 units left in stock, as the `items` list is empty and the `total_count` is 0.

Since there are no products matching the criteria, the answer to the question is that there are no SKUs with 1-3 units left.

Finish[]
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 9:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Since the initial search for products with 1-3 units left returned no results, I'll try a different approach to ensure that the search criteria are correctly applied. I'll use the `export_stock_salable_quantity_GET` tool to explore the stock data and identify any products that might have low stock levels.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `export_stock_salable_quantity_GET` tool to understand how to use it effectively.

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `export_stock_salable_quantity_GET` tool allows us to export product stock data filtered by search criteria. To find products with 1-3 units left, I'll use this tool with appropriate search criteria.

I'll call this function with the following parameters:

Let's proceed with calling this function.

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response indicates that the attribute name "quantity" is invalid for the search criteria. This suggests that the field name might be different or not directly accessible through this API.

Given this, I'll try using the `get_product_list_GET` tool to retrieve a list of products and then filter them programmatically to find those with 1-3 units left. I'll first check the documentation for the `get_product_list_GET` tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_product_list_GET` tool allows us to retrieve a list of products with filtering, sorting, and pagination options. However, it doesn't directly provide inventory information. 

Given the constraints, I'll attempt to retrieve a list of products and then check if there's any way to filter or sort by inventory quantity. If not, I may need to explore other tools or approaches to access inventory data.

Let's proceed by calling the `get_product_list_GET` tool to retrieve a list of products.

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_product_list_GET` tool provides a list of products, but it doesn't directly include inventory quantity information. Since the previous attempts to access inventory data through other tools were unsuccessful, I need to explore the available data further.

I'll retrieve the full response for the product list and check if there are any attributes related to inventory or stock quantity within the `extension_attributes` or `custom_attributes` fields. This will help determine if there's any hidden inventory information that can be used.

Let's explore the full response to see if there's any relevant inventory data.
CODE:
from utils import get_response, list_all_paths
list_all_paths('response_3')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
'Available paths in response_3 (depth ≤ 10):\n  [items]\n  [items][0]\n  [items][0][id]\n  [items][0][sku]\n  [items][0][name]\n  [items][0][attribute_set_id]\n  [items][0][price]\n  [items][0][status]\n  [items][0][visibility]\n  [items][0][type_id]\n  [items][0][created_at]\n  [items][0][updated_at]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][website_ids]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][website_ids][0]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links][0]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links][0][position]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links][0][category_id]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links][1]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links][1][position]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links][1][category_id]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links][2]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links][2][position]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links][2][category_id]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][category_links][...]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][id]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][attribute_id]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][label]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][position]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][values]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][values][0]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][values][0][value_index]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][values][1]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][values][1][value_index]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][values][2]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][values][2][value_index]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][0][product_id]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][1]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][1][id]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][1][attribute_id]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][1][label]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][1][position]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][1][values]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][1][values][0]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][1][values][0][value_index]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][1][values][1]\n  [items][0][extension_attributes][configurable_product_options][1][values][1][value_index]\n\n... (showing first 50 paths)'

Step 15:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The available paths in the response do not show any direct inventory or stock quantity information. Since the previous attempts to access inventory data through other tools were unsuccessful, and the product list does not include inventory details, it seems that the current API tools and data do not provide a direct way to access the inventory quantities needed to find products with 1-3 units left.

Given these constraints, I am unable to provide the SKUs of products with 1-3 units left using the available tools and data.

Finish[]
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 16:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 17:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Given the constraints and the tools available, I will attempt one more approach to find the SKUs of products with 1-3 units left. I'll use the `get_low_stock_items_GET` tool again, but this time I'll adjust the parameters to see if there might have been an issue with the previous call.

I'll call the `get_low_stock_items_GET` tool with a `qty` parameter set to 3, and I'll ensure that the `scopeId` is correctly set to 1, which is typically used for default stock scope. Let's proceed with this call.
CODE:
response = call_function('get_low_stock_items_GET', site='shopping_admin', scopeId=1, qty=3, currentPage=1, pageSize=20)

 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_4',
 '_original_response': <Response [200]>}

Step 18:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The response again indicates that there are no products with 1-3 units left in stock, as the `items` list is empty and the `total_count` is 0.

Given the repeated results and the constraints of the available tools, it seems that there are no products with 1-3 units left in the current inventory data.

Finish[]

THOUGHT: Given the constraints and the tools available, I will attempt one more approach to find the SKUs of products with 1-3 units left. I'll use the `get_low_stock_items_GET` tool again, but this time I'll adjust the parameters to see if there might have been an issue with the previous call.

I'll call the `get_low_stock_items_GET` tool with a `qty` parameter set to 3, and I'll ensure that the `scopeId` is correctly set to 1, which is typically used for default stock scope. Let's proceed with this call.
