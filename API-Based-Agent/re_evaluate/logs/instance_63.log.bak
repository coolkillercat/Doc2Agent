Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Which customer(s) has completed the second most number of orders in the entire history?***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the customer(s) with the second most number of completed orders, I will proceed with the following steps:

1. Use the `list_orders_GET` tool to retrieve all orders.
2. Analyze the orders to count the number of completed orders for each customer.
3. Determine which customer(s) have the second most number of completed orders.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `list_orders_GET` tool to understand how to retrieve the order data.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('list_orders_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_orders_GET` tool allows us to list orders based on specified search criteria, including filtering by status and sorting by fields like `created_at`. To find the customer(s) with the second most number of completed orders, I will:

1. Retrieve all orders with the status 'complete'.
2. Count the number of completed orders for each customer.
3. Identify the customer(s) with the second most completed orders.

Let's start by retrieving all completed orders using the `list_orders_GET` tool.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Retrieve all completed orders
response = call_function(
    'list_orders_GET',
    site='shopping_admin',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_field='status',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_value='complete',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_conditionType='eq',

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response for the completed orders was truncated, so I'll retrieve the full response and analyze it to count the number of completed orders for each customer. Let's proceed with that.
CODE:
from utils import get_response, search_key, get_value_at_path

# Retrieve the full response
full_response = get_response('response_1')

# Extract customer IDs and count completed orders for each customer
order_counts = {}
for order in full_response['items']:
    customer_id = order.get('customer_id')
    if customer_id:
        order_counts[customer_id] = order_counts.get(customer_id, 0) + 1

# Find the second most number of completed orders
sorted_order_counts = sorted(order_counts.values(), reverse=True)
second_most_orders = sorted_order_counts[1] if len(sorted_order_counts) > 1 else None

# Find customers with the second most number of completed orders
second_most_customers = [customer_id for customer_id, count in order_counts.items() if count == second_most_orders]

second_most_customers
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
[18, 3, 29]

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The customer IDs with the second most number of completed orders are [18, 3, 29]. Now, I need to retrieve the names of these customers using their IDs. I'll use the `get_customer_GET` tool to get the customer details.

Let's start by checking the documentation for the `get_customer_GET` tool to understand how to retrieve customer information.
CODE:
get_documentation('get_customer_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/get_customer_GET.py
'"""\nGet customer by Customer ID.\n    \n    Args:\n        customerId (int): The ID of the customer to retrieve.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns detailed customer information including personal details, addresses, and subscription status for a specified customer ID.\n    Example:\n        >>> response = get_customer(customerId=1)\n        >>> print(response.status_code)\n        200\n""" example: get_customer(customerId=1)'

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_customer_GET` tool allows us to retrieve detailed customer information using a customer ID. I'll use this tool to get the names of the customers with IDs [18, 3, 29].

Let's start by retrieving the customer information for these IDs.
CODE:
# Retrieve customer details for each ID
customer_names = []
for customer_id in [18, 3, 29]:
    response = call_function('get_customer_GET', site='shopping_admin', customerId=customer_id)
    customer_info = response['content']
    customer_name = f"{customer_info.get('firstname', '')} {customer_info.get('lastname', '')}"
    customer_names.append(customer_name)
