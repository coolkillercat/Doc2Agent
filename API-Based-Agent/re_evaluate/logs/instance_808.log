CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Create an issue in cloud-to-butt repo with title "Let's keep the project alive". Assign the issue to myself. Set due date to be the end of Q1 2033***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To create an issue in the "cloud-to-butt" repository on GitLab, I will follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the "projects" category to find the project ID for the "cloud-to-butt" repository.
2. Use the project ID to create an issue in the "issues" category.
3. Assign the issue to myself and set the due date to the end of Q1 2033.

Let's start by listing the tools in the "projects" category to find the project ID.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Now that we have the list of available tools in the "projects" category, we need to find the project ID for the "cloud-to-butt" repository. We can use the `list_projects` tool to retrieve a list of projects and identify the correct project ID.

Let's get the documentation for the `list_projects` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/projects/list_projects.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_projects` tool allows us to retrieve a list of GitLab projects with various filtering options. We can use the `search` parameter to find the "cloud-to-butt" project specifically.

Let's call the `list_projects` function with the `search` parameter set to "cloud-to-butt" to find the project ID.

THOUGHT: We have successfully retrieved the project ID for the "cloud-to-butt" repository. The project ID is 189.

Next, we need to create an issue in this project. Let's list the available tools in the "issues" category to find the appropriate tool for creating an issue.

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_project_issue` tool allows us to create a new issue in a GitLab project with various customizable properties. We need to provide the `project_id`, `title`, and optionally the `assignee_ids` and `due_date`.

Let's proceed to create the issue in the "cloud-to-butt" project with the title "Let's keep the project alive", assign it to myself, and set the due date to the end of Q1 2033 (March 31, 2033).

THOUGHT: We have successfully retrieved the user ID, which is 2330. Now, we can proceed to create the issue in the "cloud-to-butt" project with the title "Let's keep the project alive", assign it to myself (user ID 2330), and set the due date to March 31, 2033.

Let's call the `create_project_issue` function with the necessary parameters.
CODE:
issue_creation_response = call_function(
    'create_project_issue',
    site='gitlab',

    project_id=189,
    title="Let's keep the project alive",
