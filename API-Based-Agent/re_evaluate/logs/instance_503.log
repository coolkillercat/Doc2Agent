CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Make all rocco gym tank as out of stock***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: To proceed with making all "rocco gym tank" products out of stock, I'll follow these steps:

1. Use the `search_products_by_name` tool to find all products with the name "rocco gym tank".
2. Use the `update_stock_item_PUT` tool to update the stock status of these products to "out of stock".

Let's start by checking the documentation for the `search_products_by_name` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_name.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name` tool allows us to search for products using a name pattern with SQL LIKE syntax. We can use `%` as a wildcard to match parts of the product name.

Next, I'll use this tool to search for products with the name "rocco gym tank". I'll set the `name_pattern` to `%rocco gym tank%` to ensure we capture all variations of the product name.

Let's perform the search.
CODE:

Step 9:

To proceed, I'll update the stock status of each "Rocco Gym Tank" product to "out of stock" by setting `is_in_stock` to `False`. However, I need to determine the `itemId` for each product, which might require additional steps if not directly available.

Let's start by attempting to update the stock status for one of the products to see if the `itemId` is required or if it can be inferred.
CODE:
# Attempt to update stock status for one product
