Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Get the order number of my most recent complete order ***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 5:

THOUGHT: To find the order number of your most recent complete order, I'll follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the shopping site to identify the relevant API for retrieving order information.
2. Check the documentation for the tool that allows searching or listing orders.
3. Use the appropriate API call to find your most recent complete order.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find your most recent complete order, I will use the `search_orders_by_status_admin` tool, which allows searching for orders with a specific status. Let's first check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.

I'll proceed to get the documentation for the `search_orders_by_status_admin` tool.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_status_admin` tool allows us to search for orders with a specific status, such as 'complete'. We can also sort the results by the creation date to find the most recent order.

I'll now call this function to search for your most recent complete order, sorting by the creation date in descending order to get the latest one first.

Let's proceed with the API call.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for the most recent complete order for Emma Lopez
result = call_function(
    'search_orders_by_status_admin',
    site='shopping',

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search returned an order with the email "jane.doe@hotmail.com", which is not Emma Lopez's email. It seems we need to filter the orders specifically for Emma Lopez.

Let's use the `search_orders_by_customer_admin` tool to search for orders placed by Emma Lopez and filter for the most recent complete order.

I'll proceed to get the documentation for the `search_orders_by_customer_admin` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:

Step 9:

THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_customer_admin` tool allows us to search for all orders placed by a specific customer. However, it requires the customer ID, which we don't have yet. 

To find Emma Lopez's customer ID, we can use the `search_customers_GET_admin` tool to search for her by email. Let's proceed to get the documentation for the `search_customers_GET_admin` tool to understand how to use it.

Step 13:

THOUGHT: It seems that the search is still returning orders for a different customer. I need to ensure that the search is specifically for Emma Lopez's orders with a "complete" status.

Let's refine the search to include Emma Lopez's customer ID and the "complete" status to find her most recent complete order.

I'll proceed with this refined search.
CODE:
# Search for Emma Lopez's most recent complete order using her customer ID
complete_order_result_for_emma = call_function(

Step 14:
