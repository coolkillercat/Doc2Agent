CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Change the page title of "Enable Cookies" page on my site to "Cookie monster coming to your place".***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

THOUGHT: It seems that none of the tools we've explored so far are directly related to updating page titles or content for specific pages like "Enable Cookies." 

Given the extensive list of tools, it's possible that the tool we need is not explicitly named in a way that indicates it handles CMS or page settings. Since we have limited turns left, I'll try one more approach by checking the documentation for a tool that might be related to CMS or page management. Let's try the `get_custom_option_types_GET` tool to see if it provides any relevant information.
CODE:
get_documentation('get_custom_option_types_GET', site='shopping_admin')
