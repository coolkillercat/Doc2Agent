CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Start a private project agi_index with HTML template and add Vinta Chen as members***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To start a private project named "agi_index" with an HTML template and add Vinta Chen as a member, I'll follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the "projects" category to find tools for creating a project.
2. Get documentation for the tool that allows project creation.
3. Call the function to create the project with the specified parameters.
4. List available tools in the "members" category to find tools for adding members.
5. Get documentation for the tool that allows adding members to a project.
6. Call the function to add Vinta Chen as a member to the newly created project.

Let's start by listing the tools in the "projects" category.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: The tool we need to create a project is `create_project`. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand the parameters required for creating a project.

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_project` tool allows us to create a new GitLab project with various customizable settings. For our task, we need to create a private project named "agi_index" with an HTML template. We will set the visibility to "private" and initialize the project with a README file.

Let's proceed to create the project using the `create_project` tool.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Create a private project named "agi_index" with an HTML template
project_creation_response = call_function(

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The project "agi_index" has been successfully created with the following details:
- Project ID: 213
- Description: A private project with HTML template
- Visibility: Private

Next, we need to add Vinta Chen as a member to this project. Let's list the tools in the "members" category to find the appropriate tool for adding members.

Let's proceed to add Vinta Chen as a member to the "agi_index" project using the `invite_member` tool. We'll assume a standard access level for a project member, such as "Developer" which typically corresponds to an access level of 30.
CODE:
# Add Vinta Chen as a member to the project with ID 213
