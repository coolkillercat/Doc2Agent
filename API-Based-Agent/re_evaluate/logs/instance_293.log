Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Show me the command to clone Super_Awesome_Robot with SSH.***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in a specific category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
# Then, get documentation for a specific tool
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
# Finally, call the function with appropriate parameters
call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id='183', commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the command to clone the repository "Super_Awesome_Robot" with SSH, we need to interact with the GitLab API to retrieve the SSH URL for the repository. Let's start by listing the available tools in the 'projects' category, as this is likely where we can find information about repositories.

I'll begin by listing the tools in the 'projects' category.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the SSH URL for cloning the "Super_Awesome_Robot" repository, we should use the `get_project_details` tool, as it retrieves detailed information about a specific project, including repository URLs.

Let's proceed by checking the documentation for the `get_project_details` tool to understand the required parameters.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('get_project_details', site='gitlab', category='projects')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/projects/get_project_details.py
'"""\nRetrieves detailed information about a specific project, including description, visibility, repository URLs, and other project metadata. Useful for project management and monitoring.\n    \n    Args:\n        project_id: The ID of the project to retrieve\n        include_license: Include project license data\n        include_statistics: Include project statistics (requires at least Reporter role)\n        include_custom_attributes: Include custom attributes in response (administrators only)\n        \n    Returns:\n        Retrieves detailed information about a specific project, including description, visibility, repository URLs, and other project metadata.\n""" example: get_project_details(project_id=183, include_statistics=True)'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_project_details` tool requires the `project_id` to retrieve detailed information about a specific project, including repository URLs. We need to find the project ID for "Super_Awesome_Robot" to proceed.

Let's use the `list_projects` tool to search for the project and obtain its ID. I'll check the documentation for `list_projects` to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/projects/list_projects.py

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_projects` tool allows us to search for projects by name using the `search` parameter. We can use this to find the project ID for "Super_Awesome_Robot".

Let's call the `list_projects` function with the search parameter set to "Super_Awesome_Robot" to find the project ID.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
result = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects', search='Super_Awesome_Robot')
print(result)
