Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***What is the top-1 best-selling product type in Quarter 1 2022***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

THOUGHT: To determine the top-1 best-selling product type in Quarter 1 2022, I'll follow these steps:

1. List available tools for the `shopping_admin` site to identify the relevant API for retrieving sales data.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the top-1 best-selling product type in Quarter 1 2022, we need to retrieve order data for that period. The tool `list_orders_GET` seems relevant for listing orders based on search criteria. Let's check its documentation to understand how to use it for our purpose.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('list_orders_GET', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/list_orders_GET.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_orders_GET` tool allows us to list orders based on specified search criteria, including filtering by fields such as `created_at`. We can use this tool to retrieve orders from Quarter 1 2022 (January to March 2022).

Let's proceed to call this function to get the order data for that period.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Retrieve orders from January 1, 2022, to March 31, 2022
response = call_function(
    'list_orders_GET',
    site='shopping_admin',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_field='created_at',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_value='2022-01-01',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_conditionType='gteq',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_field='created_at',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_value='2022-03-31',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_conditionType='lteq',
    searchCriteria_sortOrders_0_field='created_at',
    searchCriteria_sortOrders_0_direction='ASC',
    searchCriteria_pageSize=100,
    searchCriteria_currentPage=1
)
response
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

site: shopping_admin
parameter: searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_field=created_at, searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_value=2022-01-01, searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_conditionType=gteq, searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_field=created_at, searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_value=2022-03-31, searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_conditionType=lteq, searchCriteria_sortOrders_0_field=created_at, searchCriteria_sortOrders_0_direction=ASC, searchCriteria_pageSize=100, searchCriteria_currentPage=1
'Error calling function \'list_orders_GET\': list_orders() got an unexpected keyword argument \'searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_field\'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/workspace/utils.py", line 780, in call_function\n    result = target_function(**kwargs)\nTypeError: list_orders() got an unexpected keyword argument \'searchCriteria_filterGroups_1_filters_0_field\'\n'

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error with the parameters used in the API call. The `list_orders_GET` tool does not support multiple filter groups as I attempted. I'll adjust the approach to use a single filter group with a combined condition for the date range.

Let's try calling the function again with a corrected approach.
CODE:
# Correcting the API call to use a single filter group for the date range
response = call_function(
    'list_orders_GET',
    site='shopping_admin',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_field='created_at',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_value='2022-01-01',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_0_conditionType='gteq',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_1_field='created_at',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_1_value='2022-03-31',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups_0_filters_1_conditionType='lteq',
    searchCriteria_sortOrders_0_field='created_at',
    searchCriteria_sortOrders_0_direction='ASC',
    searchCriteria_pageSize=100,
    searchCriteria_currentPage=1

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems the `list_orders_GET` tool does not support multiple filters within a single filter group either. I will simplify the approach to retrieve orders for each month separately within Quarter 1 2022 and then combine the results.

Let's start by retrieving orders for January 2022.
CODE:
# Retrieve orders for January 2022
response_january = call_function(
    'list_orders_GET',
