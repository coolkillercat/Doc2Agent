Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To accomplish the task of pulling up the description page of Piada restaurant near Pitt on Map, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to understand what functionalities are available.
2. Check the documentation for any relevant tool that can help in searching for a restaurant or pulling up its description.
3. Use the appropriate API call to find the Piada restaurant near Pitt and retrieve its description page.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the description page of Piada restaurant near Pitt, the most relevant tool seems to be `search_GET`, which allows searching for locations using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API. 

Let's check the documentation for the `search_GET` tool to understand how to use it for searching the restaurant.
CODE:

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_GET` tool allows us to search for locations using a free-form query or structured parameters. To find the Piada restaurant near Pitt, we can use a free-form query with the restaurant name and location.

Let's proceed to call the `search_GET` function with the appropriate parameters to find the Piada restaurant near Pitt.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for Piada restaurant near Pitt
result = call_function('search_GET', site='map', q='Piada restaurant near University of Pittsburgh', format='json', limit=1, addressdetails=1)
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

status_code: 200
content: []
parameter: q=Piada restaurant near University of Pittsburgh, format=json, limit=1, addressdetails=1
<Response [200]>

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search did not return any results for "Piada restaurant near University of Pittsburgh." This could be due to various reasons, such as the restaurant not being listed under that name or location in the OpenStreetMap database.

Let's try a slightly different approach by searching for "Piada Italian Street Food" near the University of Pittsburgh, as this might be the full name of the restaurant.

I'll perform another search with this updated query.
CODE:
# Try searching with a more specific name
result = call_function('search_GET', site='map', q='Piada Italian Street Food near University of Pittsburgh', format='json', limit=1, addressdetails=1)
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: search_GET
site: map

status_code: 200
content: []
parameter: q=Piada Italian Street Food near University of Pittsburgh, format=json, limit=1, addressdetails=1
<Response [200]>

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the search is still not returning any results. This could be due to the restaurant not being listed in the OpenStreetMap database under the expected name or location.

As an alternative, we can try a more general search for restaurants near the University of Pittsburgh and manually inspect the results to see if Piada is listed under a different name or address.

Let's perform a general search for restaurants near the University of Pittsburgh.
CODE:
# General search for restaurants near the University of Pittsburgh
result = call_function('search_GET', site='map', q='restaurant near University of Pittsburgh', format='json', limit=10, addressdetails=1)
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

parameter: q=restaurant near University of Pittsburgh, format=json, limit=10, addressdetails=1
<Response [200]>

Step 9:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The search returned a list of restaurants near the University of Pittsburgh, but it seems that Piada is not among the results. The first result is "Brioche Dorée," which indicates that the search is working but not finding Piada specifically.

Given the limitations of the current search results, it might be that Piada is not listed in the OpenStreetMap database, or it might be listed under a different name or category.

Unfortunately, without a direct match for Piada, we cannot pull up its description page from the current data. If you have any other specific details or alternative names for the restaurant, we could try searching again with those.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! Otherwise, I will conclude this task.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 10:

After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Given the current situation, let's try a different approach by using the `place_details_GET` tool, which might provide more detailed information about specific places if we can identify the correct place ID or name.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `place_details_GET` tool to understand how it can be used to retrieve detailed information about a place.
CODE:
get_documentation('place_details_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `place_details_GET` tool requires specific parameters such as `osmtype`, `osmid`, or `place_id` to retrieve detailed information about a place. Since we don't have these identifiers for Piada, we need to first identify them.

Given the previous search results, we didn't find Piada directly. However, we can try to find a nearby place and see if it provides any linked places or additional information that might lead us to Piada.

Let's use the `place_details_GET` tool on the first result we obtained earlier, "Brioche Dorée," to see if it provides any linked places or additional information.
CODE:
# Use place_details_GET on the first result from the previous search

Step 13:

CONTENT: The `place_details_GET` call for "Brioche Dorée" returned detailed information, but it did not provide any linked places that could lead us to Piada. It seems that Piada might not be listed in the OpenStreetMap database under the expected name or location.

Given the current data and the limitations of the available tools, we are unable to directly pull up the description page for Piada restaurant near Pitt. The restaurant might be listed under a different name, or it might not be present in the OpenStreetMap database.

If you have any other specific details or alternative names for the restaurant, we could try searching again with those. Otherwise, this concludes the current task based on the available data.

THOUGHT: Given the current situation, let's try a different approach by using the `search_GET` tool with a broader search query to see if we can find any related results for Piada or similar restaurants near the University of Pittsburgh.

I'll perform a search for "Italian restaurant near University of Pittsburgh" to see if it yields any relevant results.
CODE:
# Search for Italian restaurants near the University of Pittsburgh
result = call_function('search_GET', site='map', q='Italian restaurant near University of Pittsburgh', format='json', limit=10, addressdetails=1)

CONTENT: It seems that the search for "Italian restaurant near University of Pittsburgh" also did not return any results. This suggests that there might be a limitation in the OpenStreetMap database for this specific query or location.

Given the constraints and the lack of results from the available tools, it appears that we are unable to directly retrieve the description page for Piada restaurant near Pitt using the current API setup.

If there are no further specific details or alternative approaches to try, I will conclude this task based on the available data.

Step 18:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Given the current situation and the lack of results from previous searches, let's try a different approach by using the `nearest_service_GET` tool. This tool can snap a coordinate to the street network and return the nearest matches, which might help us find nearby restaurants.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `nearest_service_GET` tool to understand how it can be used.
CODE:
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/nearest_service_GET.py
'"""\nFinds the nearest street segments for a given coordinate.\n    \n    Args:\n        coordinates (str): A string of format \'{longitude},{latitude}\'. Required.\n        number (int, optional): Number of nearest segments that should be returned. Defaults to 1.\n        profile (int, optional): Mode of transportation. 5000 for car, 5001 for bicycle, 5002 for foot.

Step 19:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool finds the nearest street segments for a given coordinate. To use this tool, we need to provide coordinates near the University of Pittsburgh. We can then look for nearby restaurants, which might include Piada.

Let's proceed by using the coordinates for the University of Pittsburgh and find the nearest street segments.
CODE:
# Use the nearest_service_GET tool with coordinates for the University of Pittsburgh
coordinates = '-79.960835,40.444167'  # Approximate coordinates for the University of Pittsburgh
