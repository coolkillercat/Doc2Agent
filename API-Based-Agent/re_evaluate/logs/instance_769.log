CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***We've received 378 brown Aero daily fitness tee in every size, please update the inventory.***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To update the inventory for the "brown Aero daily fitness tee," we need to use the appropriate tool. Based on the list of available tools, the `update_stock_item_PUT` tool seems to be the right choice for updating stock information for a product.

Next, let's check the documentation for the `update_stock_item_PUT` tool to understand the required parameters for updating the inventory.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('update_stock_item_PUT', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/update_stock_item_PUT.py
'"""\nUpdate stock information for a product.\n    \n    Args:\n        productSku (str): The SKU of the product to update (required)\n        itemId (str or int): The ID of the stock item to update (required)\n        stockItem (dict): Stock information to update (required)\n            Example: {\'qty\': 100, \'is_in_stock\': True}\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns the stock item ID after updating a product\'s inventory information.\n    Example:\n        update_stock_item(\n            productSku=\'test-product-sku\',\n            itemId=\'1\',\n            stockItem={\'qty\': 100, \'is_in_stock\': True}\n        )\n""" example: update_stock_item(productSku=\'test-product-sku\', itemId=\'1\', stockItem={\'qty\': 100, \'is_in_stock\': True})'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `update_stock_item_PUT` tool requires the following parameters to update the stock information for a product:

- `productSku` (str): The SKU of the product to update (required)
- `itemId` (str or int): The ID of the stock item to update (required)
- `stockItem` (dict): Stock information to update (required), e.g., `{'qty': 100, 'is_in_stock': True}`

To proceed, we need to:
1. Find the SKU and stock item ID for the "brown Aero daily fitness tee."
2. Use the `update_stock_item_PUT` tool to update the inventory with the specified quantity of 378.

Let's start by searching for the product to find its SKU and stock item ID.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Search for the product by name to find its SKU and stock item ID
call_function('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin', name='brown Aero daily fitness tee')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error with the parameters used for the `search_products_by_name` function. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand the correct parameters required for searching products by name.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_name.py

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name` tool requires the following parameters:

- `name_pattern` (str): The pattern to search for in product names using SQL LIKE syntax (`%` is used as a wildcard).
- Optional parameters like `page_size`, `current_page`, `sort_by`, `sort_direction`, and `return_fields`.

Let's search for the "brown Aero daily fitness tee" using the correct parameter `name_pattern` with a wildcard to ensure we capture the product correctly.
CODE:
# Search for the product using the correct name pattern
call_function('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin', name_pattern='%Aero daily fitness tee%', return_fields=['name', 'sku'])

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The search returned multiple products with different SKUs for the "Aero Daily Fitness Tee" in various colors and sizes. We need to focus on the "brown" variants to update their inventory.

Let's explore the stored response to identify the SKUs for the "brown" variants.
CODE:
# Explore the response to find SKUs for the "brown" variants
from utils import get_response, search_value
search_value('response_1', 'Brown')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 11:

- S: `MS01-S-Brown`
- M: `MS01-M-Brown`
- L: `MS01-L-Brown`
- XL: `MS01-XL-Brown`

Next, we need to update the inventory for each of these SKUs with a quantity of 378. Let's proceed with updating the inventory for these SKUs using the `update_stock_item_PUT` tool. We'll start with the first SKU and repeat the process for each size.
