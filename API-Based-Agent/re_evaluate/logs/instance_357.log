Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Checkout merge requests requiring my review***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find merge requests requiring your review on GitLab, we need to follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the `merge_requests` category to find the appropriate tool for checking merge requests.
2. Get the documentation for the relevant tool to understand the required parameters.
3. Call the function to retrieve merge requests requiring your review.

Let's start by listing the tools in the `merge_requests` category.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='merge_requests')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'
DEBUG: Looking for GitLab subdirectory tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/merge_requests/tool_description.json
DEBUG: File exists: True
DEBUG: Successfully read tool_description.json for merge_requests
"Available tools in GitLab merge_requests:\n- get_merge_request_participants: Retrieves a list of all participants involved in a specific merge request, providing user details such as name, username, avatar URL, and web URL.\n- get_merge_request_reviewers: Retrieves a list of reviewers assigned to a specific merge request, including their user information and review state (unreviewed/reviewed).\n- merge_request_ref: Merges changes between source and target branches into a special reference path (refs/merge-requests/:iid/merge) \nwithout affecting the actual target branch, allowing preview of the merge result.\n- reset_merge_request_spent_time: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- rebase_merge_request: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_milestone_merge_requests: Retrieves all merge requests assigned to a specific project milestone.\n- get_merge_request_changes: Retrieves detailed information about a merge request including its files and changes.\n- merge_merge_request: Accepts and merges changes submitted with a merge request in GitLab.\n- get_merge_request_state_events: Retrieves the history of state changes for a specific merge request, including who changed the state and when it occurred.\n- cancel_merge_when_pipeline_succeeds: Cancels the automatic merge of a merge request that was previously set to merge when its pipeline succeeds, returning the updated merge request details.\n- subscribe_to_merge_request: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- add_merge_request_spent_time: Records time spent working on a specific merge request.\n- create_merge_request: Creates a new merge request between two branches.\n- get_merge_request: Retrieves detailed information about a specific merge request in a project, including its current status, assignees, and other metadata.\n- list_merge_request_pipelines: Retrieves a list of pipelines associated with a specific merge request in a project, allowing developers to track CI/CD processes for code changes.\n- get_merge_request_discussions: Retrieves all discussion threads and comments for a specific merge request, allowing users to review feedback and commentary on code changes.\n- get_merge_request_approvals: Retrieves approval information for a specific merge request, allowing users to see who has approved the merge request and what approval rules apply.\n- list_merge_requests: Retrieves merge requests based on specified filters, allowing users to find MRs by state, assignee, reviewer, branch, and other attributes.\n- update_merge_request: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_merge_request_diff_version: Retrieves a specific version of a merge request diff, including commit details and file changes.\n- list_group_merge_requests: Retrieves merge requests for a specified group and its subgroups with customizable filtering options.\n- create_merge_request_pipeline: Creates a pipeline for a merge request, which can be a detached merge request pipeline or a merged results pipeline depending on project settings.\n- create_merge_request_comment: Creates a new comment on a specific merge request in GitLab.\n- get_merge_request_notes: Retrieves all notes/comments for a specific merge request, with options to sort and order the results.\n- get_merge_request_diffs: Retrieves the list of file diffs in a merge request, showing what changes were made to each file including additions, deletions, and modifications."

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have a list of tools available in the `merge_requests` category. To find merge requests requiring your review, the `list_merge_requests` tool seems appropriate as it allows filtering by reviewer and other attributes.

Let's get the documentation for the `list_merge_requests` tool to understand how to use it for our purpose.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('list_merge_requests', site='gitlab', category='merge_requests')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/merge_requests/list_merge_requests.py
'"""\nRetrieves merge requests based on specified filters, allowing users to find MRs by state, assignee, reviewer, branch, and other attributes. Useful for tracking work in progress, reviewing code contributions, or monitoring merge request status.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of merge requests with detailed information including ID, title, state, branches, author details, and merge status.\n""" example: list_merge_requests(scope=\'all\', state=\'opened\', author_id=2330)'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_merge_requests` tool allows us to retrieve merge requests based on various filters, including reviewer. To find merge requests requiring your review, we need to use the appropriate filter for reviewers.

Let's proceed to call the `list_merge_requests` function with the necessary parameters to find merge requests that require your review. We'll use the `reviewer_id` parameter to filter the merge requests.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Call the function to list merge requests requiring review
merge_requests = call_function('list_merge_requests', site='gitlab', category='merge_requests', reviewer_id='your_user_id', state='opened')
merge_requests
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: list_merge_requests
site: gitlab
category: merge_requests
parameter: reviewer_id=your_user_id, state=opened

status_code: 400
content: {
  "error": "reviewer_id should be an integer, none, or any, however got your_user_id"
}

[Response stored as 'response_1' - use get_response('response_1', 'search_term') to search within it]
{'status_code': 400,
 'content': {'error': 'reviewer_id should be an integer, none, or any, however got your_user_id'},
 'url': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/merge_requests?state=opened&scope=created_by_me&reviewer_id=your_user_id&sort=desc&order_by=created_at',
 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_1',
 '_original_response': <Response [400]>}

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The error indicates that the `reviewer_id` should be an integer. We need to find the correct `reviewer_id` for your user account. To do this, we should first list the available tools in the `users` category to find a tool that can help us retrieve user information, including the user ID.

Let's list the tools in the `users` category.
CODE:
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'
DEBUG: Looking for GitLab subdirectory tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/tool_description.json

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the user ID, we can use the `get_current_user` tool, which retrieves information about the currently authenticated user. This will provide us with the necessary user ID to use in the `list_merge_requests` function.

Let's get the documentation for the `get_current_user` tool to understand its usage.
CODE:
get_documentation('get_current_user', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/get_current_user.py

Defaults to None.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns detailed profile information about the currently authenticated user, including personal details, account settings, and activity statistics.\n""" example: get_current_user()'

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_current_user` tool retrieves information about the currently authenticated user, including their user ID. This is exactly what we need to proceed with finding merge requests requiring your review.

Let's call the `get_current_user` function to obtain your user ID.
