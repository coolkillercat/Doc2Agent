1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to see what functionalities are available.
2. Check the documentation for any tool that might help in finding bus stop coordinates.
3. Use the appropriate API call to get the coordinates of the bus stop.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the coordinates of the bus stop near the Carnegie art museum side of the street near CMU, we need to identify the appropriate tool. The `search_GET` tool seems promising as it allows searching for locations using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_GET` tool to understand how to use it for our task.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_GET` tool allows us to perform a search using a free-form query or structured query parameters. For our task, we can use a free-form query to search for the bus stop near the Carnegie art museum side of the street near CMU.

Let's perform a search using the `search_GET` tool with a query that includes "bus stop Carnegie art museum CMU" and see if we can get the coordinates in the desired format.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Perform a search for the bus stop near Carnegie art museum and CMU
response = call_function(
    'search_GET',
    site='map',
    q='bus stop Carnegie art museum CMU',
    format='json',
    limit=1,
    addressdetails=1
)

response
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

status_code: 200
content: []
parameter: q=bus stop Carnegie art museum CMU, format=json, limit=1, addressdetails=1
<Response [200]>

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search query did not return any results. This might be due to the specificity or phrasing of the query. Let's try a slightly different approach by using a more general query and possibly including additional parameters like city or state to narrow down the search.

I'll attempt another search with a broader query and include the city name "Pittsburgh" to see if we can get better results.
CODE:
# Perform a search with a broader query including the city name
response = call_function(
    'search_GET',
    site='map',
    q='bus stop near Carnegie Museum of Art Pittsburgh',
    format='json',
    limit=1,
    addressdetails=1
)

response
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

status_code: 200
content: []
parameter: q=bus stop near Carnegie Museum of Art Pittsburgh, format=json, limit=1, addressdetails=1
<Response [200]>

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the search query still did not return any results. This could be due to the specificity of the location or the way the data is indexed in the OpenStreetMap database.

Let's try another approach by using the `nearest_service_GET` tool, which can snap a coordinate to the street network and return the nearest matches. We can use a known coordinate near the Carnegie Museum of Art and search for nearby bus stops.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `nearest_service_GET` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/nearest_service_GET.py
'"""\nFinds the nearest street segments for a given coordinate.\n    \n    Args:\n        coordinates (str): A string of format \'{longitude},{latitude}\'. Required.\n        number (int, optional): Number of nearest segments that should be returned. Defaults to 1.\n        profile (int, optional): Mode of transportation. 5000 for car, 5001 for bicycle, 5002 for foot.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool can be used to find the nearest street segments for a given coordinate. We can use this tool to find the nearest bus stop by providing a coordinate near the Carnegie Museum of Art.

Let's use a known coordinate for the Carnegie Museum of Art and search for the nearest bus stop. I'll use the approximate coordinates for the museum: longitude `-79.9471`, latitude `40.4435`.

I'll call the `nearest_service_GET` tool with these coordinates.
CODE:
# Use the nearest_service_GET tool to find the nearest bus stop
response = call_function(
    'nearest_service_GET',
    site='map',
    coordinates='-79.9471,40.4435',
    number=1,
    profile=5002  # Using 'foot' profile for pedestrian access
