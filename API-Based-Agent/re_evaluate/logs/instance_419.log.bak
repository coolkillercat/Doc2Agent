CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Set my gitlab status as Enjoying life.***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To set your GitLab status as "Enjoying life," we need to interact with the GitLab API using the appropriate tools. Let's start by listing the available tools in the "users" category, as this is likely where user status updates would be managed.

I'll begin by listing the tools in the "users" category to find the one that allows us to update the user status.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
# List available tools in the 'users' category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'
DEBUG: Looking for GitLab subdirectory tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/tool_description.json
DEBUG: File exists: True
DEBUG: Successfully read tool_description.json for users

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool we need to use is `set_user_status`, which is likely the one that allows us to update the user's status. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.

I'll proceed by getting the documentation for the `set_user_status` tool in the "users" category.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
# Get documentation for the 'set_user_status' tool
get_documentation('set_user_status', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/set_user_status.py
'"""\nSets or updates the current user\'s status with custom emoji, message, and optional auto-clear timing. Allows choosing between PUT (replace entire status) or PATCH (update only specified fields).\n\n    Args:\n        emoji (str): Name of the emoji to use as status. Default is \'speech_balloon\'.\n        message (str): Message to set as a status. Cannot exceed 100 characters.\n        clear_status_after (str): When to automatically clear status. Allowed values: \n            \'30_minutes\', \'3_hours\', \'8_hours\', \'1_day\', \'3_days\', \'7_days\', \'30_days\'\n        method (str): HTTP method to use, either \'PUT\' (replace all fields) or \'PATCH\' (update only specified fields)\n\n    Returns:\n        Returns the user\'s status information including emoji, message, availability, HTML-formatted message, and auto-clear timestamp.\n""" example: set_user_status(emoji=\'coffee\', message=\'I need more coffee\', clear_status_after=\'3_hours\', method=\'PUT\')'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `set_user_status` tool allows us to set or update the current user's status with a custom message and optional emoji. We can use either the `PUT` or `PATCH` method to update the status. For this task, we'll set the status message to "Enjoying life" using the `PATCH` method to update only the specified fields.

Let's proceed to call the `set_user_status` function with the appropriate parameters.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Set the user's status to "Enjoying life" using the PATCH method
response = call_function('set_user_status', site='gitlab', category='users', message='Enjoying life', method='PATCH')
response
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: set_user_status
site: gitlab
category: users
parameter: message=Enjoying life, method=PATCH
url: http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/user/status
status_code: 404
content: {
  "error": "404 Not Found"
}

[Response stored as 'response_1' - use get_response('response_1', 'search_term') to search within it]
{'status_code': 404,
 'content': {'error': '404 Not Found'},
 'url': 'http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/user/status',
 '_truncated_response_id': 'response_1',
 '_original_response': <Response [404]>}

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the attempt to set the user status resulted in a "404 Not Found" error. This could be due to an incorrect endpoint or missing permissions. Let's verify the endpoint and ensure that the API call is being made correctly.

I'll check the stored response for any additional details that might help us understand the issue.
CODE:
from utils import get_response
# Retrieve the full response to understand the 404 error
full_response = get_response('response_1')
full_response
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
'Full response for response_1:\n{\n  "error": "404 Not Found"\n}'

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The "404 Not Found" error indicates that the endpoint might not be correct or accessible. Let's ensure that the endpoint is correct and that we have the necessary permissions to update the user status.

I'll review the available tools again to see if there might be another tool or method to update the user status, or if there are any prerequisites we might have missed. Let's list the tools in the "misc" category, as it might contain general tools that could help with this task.
CODE:
# List available tools in the 'misc' category to check for any relevant tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='misc')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'
DEBUG: Looking for GitLab subdirectory tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/misc/tool_description.json
DEBUG: File exists: True
DEBUG: Successfully read tool_description.json for misc
"Available tools in GitLab misc:\n- add_gpg_key: Adds a new GPG key to the authenticated user's account.\n- list_gpg_keys: Retrieves all GPG keys associated with the authenticated user's GitLab account.\n- update_invitation: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_resource_events: Retrieves events associated with a specific resource, with optional filtering by event type."

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the "misc" category does not contain any tools related to updating user status. The issue might be related to permissions or the specific endpoint used.

Let's try a different approach by checking the "get_current_user" tool in the "users" category to ensure that we have the correct user context and permissions. This will help us verify if the API is accessible and if we have the necessary permissions to update the status.

I'll proceed by getting the documentation for the "get_current_user" tool and then calling it to verify the user context.
CODE:
# Get documentation for the 'get_current_user' tool
get_documentation('get_current_user', site='gitlab', category='users')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/users/get_current_user.py

Defaults to None.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns detailed profile information about the currently authenticated user, including personal details, account settings, and activity statistics.\n""" example: get_current_user()'

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_current_user` tool retrieves information about the currently authenticated user. This will help us verify if we have the correct user context and permissions.

Let's call the `get_current_user` function to check the current user details.
CODE:
# Call the 'get_current_user' function to verify user context
current_user_info = call_function('get_current_user', site='gitlab', category='users')
