Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Today is 6/12/2023. Tell me how many fulfilled orders I have over the past three days, and the total amount of money I spent.***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To determine the number of fulfilled orders over the past three days and the total amount spent, I'll follow these steps:

1. List available tools to find the appropriate API for retrieving order information.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool to understand how to use it.
3. Call the API to get the orders for the specified date range.
4. Filter the orders to find those that are fulfilled and calculate the total amount spent.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='shopping')

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the number of fulfilled orders over the past three days and the total amount spent, I will use the `search_orders_by_date_range_admin` tool to retrieve orders from the specified date range. Then, I'll filter these orders to find those with a "fulfilled" status and calculate the total amount spent.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `search_orders_by_date_range_admin` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_orders_by_date_range_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_orders_by_date_range_admin.py
'"""\nSearches for orders created within a specific date range, useful for periodic reporting or synchronization.\n    \n    Args:\n        start_date (str): The start date in format \'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\'\n        end_date (str): The end date in format \'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\'\n        page_size (int, optional): Maximum number of items to return\n        current_page (int, optional): Current page number\n        sort_by (str, optional): Field to sort by (e.g., \'created_at\')\n        sort_direction (str, optional): Sort direction, \'ASC\' or \'DESC\'\n        return_fields (list, optional): List of fields to return in the response\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of orders within a specified date range with comprehensive order details including customer information, financial data, shipping details, and order status.\n""" example: search_orders_by_date_range("2023-01-01 00:00:00", "2023-12-31 23:59:59", page_size=10, sort_by="created_at")'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_date_range_admin` tool allows us to search for orders within a specific date range. It requires the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. Optional parameters include `page_size`, `current_page`, `sort_by`, `sort_direction`, and `return_fields`.

Now, I'll call this function to retrieve orders from the past three days (from 2023-06-09 to 2023-06-12) and then filter for fulfilled orders.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Define the date range for the past three days
start_date = "2023-06-09 00:00:00"
end_date = "2023-06-12 23:59:59"

# Call the function to get orders within the specified date range
orders_response = call_function('search_orders_by_date_range_admin', site='shopping',
                                start_date=start_date,
                                end_date=end_date,
                                page_size=100,
                                sort_by='created_at',
                                sort_direction='ASC')
print(orders_response)
