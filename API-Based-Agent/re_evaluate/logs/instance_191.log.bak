Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Tell me the total cost of my latest processing order?***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

3. Use the tool to find your latest processing order.
4. Calculate the total cost of that order.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:

THOUGHT: To find the total cost of your latest processing order, I'll proceed with the following steps:

1. Use the `search_orders_by_status_admin` tool to find your latest processing order.
2. Retrieve the order details to calculate the total cost.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `search_orders_by_status_admin` tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:

Step 7:

THOUGHT: Now that I have the documentation for the `search_orders_by_status_admin` tool, I can use it to find your latest processing order. I'll search for orders with the status "processing" and sort them by the creation date to find the latest one.

Let's proceed with calling the function to search for your latest processing order.
CODE:

Step 8:

THOUGHT: It seems that there are no processing orders found for your account at the moment. This could mean that there are no orders with the status "processing" or that the orders are not associated with your email.

To ensure we are checking orders specifically for you, I'll use the `search_orders_by_customer_admin` tool to find your orders and then filter for the latest processing order.
