Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Tell me the total spend on products in the most recent cancelled orders of the customer who has the most cancellations in the history***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the total spend on products in the most recent cancelled orders of the customer with the most cancellations, I'll follow these steps:

1. List available tools to understand what functions are available for interacting with the shopping admin site.
2. Identify the tool to list orders and find the customer with the most cancellations.
3. Retrieve the most recent cancelled orders for that customer.
4. Calculate the total spend on products in those orders.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To proceed, I'll need to identify the tools that can help us find the customer with the most cancellations and retrieve their most recent cancelled orders. Based on the available tools, the following steps will be taken:

1. Use `search_orders_by_status` to find all cancelled orders and identify the customer with the most cancellations.
2. Use `search_orders_by_customer` to retrieve the most recent cancelled orders for that customer.
3. Calculate the total spend on products in those orders.

Let's start by checking the documentation for `search_orders_by_status` to understand how to use it to find cancelled orders.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_orders_by_status', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_orders_by_status.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_status` tool allows us to search for orders with a specific status, such as 'cancelled'. It supports pagination and sorting, which will be useful for retrieving all relevant orders and identifying the customer with the most cancellations.

Next, I'll use this tool to search for all cancelled orders and analyze the data to find the customer with the most cancellations.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

Let's use the `search_orders` tool to retrieve a larger set of orders and check for any cancelled ones.
