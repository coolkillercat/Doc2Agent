CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Open an issue to ask their plans on adding Python 3.11 related resources in awesome-python.***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

1. Identify the project ID for the "awesome-python" repository.
2. Use the project ID to open a new issue in the repository.

Let's start by listing the available tools in the "projects" category to find the appropriate tool for retrieving project IDs.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the project ID for the "awesome-python" repository, we can use the `list_projects` tool. This tool will allow us to retrieve a list of GitLab projects and identify the one we need.

Let's proceed by getting the documentation for the `list_projects` tool to understand its usage and parameters. Then, we'll call the function to find the project ID for "awesome-python".
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
# Get documentation for the list_projects tool
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_projects` tool allows us to search for projects by various criteria, including a search term. We can use this tool to search for the "awesome-python" project.

Let's call the `list_projects` function with the search parameter set to "awesome-python" to find the project ID.
