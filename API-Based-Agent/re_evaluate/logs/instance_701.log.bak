CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Draft a new marketing price rule for Mother's day sale that offers $15 discount on checkout for all customers***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To draft a new marketing price rule for a Mother's Day sale, we need to find a tool related to creating or managing price rules. From the list of available tools, it seems there isn't a direct tool named for creating price rules. However, tools related to product pricing or promotions might be relevant.

Let's check the documentation for the `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool to see if it can be used for creating a discount rule or if it provides any insights into managing price rules.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('add_or_update_product_prices_POST', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/add_or_update_product_prices_POST.py

Step 7:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The `add_or_update_product_prices_POST` tool is used for adding or updating product tier prices, which involves setting specific prices for products based on SKU, price type, website ID, customer group, and quantity. This tool is not directly related to creating a marketing price rule for a discount on checkout.

Since this tool doesn't seem to fit our requirement for creating a checkout discount rule, let's explore another approach. We should look for a tool that might be related to promotions or discounts at checkout.

I'll search for any tool that might be related to creating promotions or discounts by checking the list of tools again for any relevant keywords like "promotion", "discount", or "rule". Let's see if there's a tool that fits our needs.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 8:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
