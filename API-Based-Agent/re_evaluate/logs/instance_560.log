CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***Create a repo named nolan_academy_awards with movies that won Academy Awards by Christopher Nolan in a README file***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='category') - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list tools in multiple categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To create a repository named `nolan_academy_awards` with a README file containing movies that won Academy Awards by Christopher Nolan, I'll follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the `projects` category to find tools for creating a new project.
2. Get documentation for the tool that allows creating a new project.
3. Call the function to create the repository.
4. List available tools in the `repository_files` category to find tools for creating or updating files in the repository.
5. Get documentation for the tool that allows creating or updating a README file.
6. Call the function to create the README file with the required content.

Let's start by listing the tools in the `projects` category.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool `create_project` is available in the `projects` category, which allows us to create a new GitLab project. Let's get the documentation for this tool to understand the required parameters for creating a new project.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
# Get documentation for the create_project tool
get_documentation('create_project', site='gitlab', category='projects')

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_project` tool allows us to create a new GitLab project with various customizable settings. To create the repository `nolan_academy_awards` with a README file, we need to provide the following parameters:

- `name`: The name of the new project, which will be "nolan_academy_awards".
- `description`: A short description of the project.
- `visibility`: The visibility level of the project, which can be "private", "internal", or "public".
- `initialize_with_readme`: Set to `True` to create the project with a README file.

Let's proceed to create the project with these parameters.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Call the function to create the project
project_creation_response = call_function(
    'create_project',
    site='gitlab',
    category='projects',

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The project `nolan_academy_awards` has been successfully created with a README file. Now, we need to update the README file with the list of movies that won Academy Awards by Christopher Nolan.

Next, I'll list the tools in the `repository_files` category to find the tool for updating the README file.
CODE:
# List tools in the repository_files category to find tools for updating files
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='repository_files')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the available tools in the `repository_files` category do not include a direct method for updating a file. However, the `get_raw_file` tool can retrieve the raw content of a file, which might be useful if we need to read the current content before updating it.

To update the README file, we typically need a tool that allows us to create or update files in the repository. Since this tool is not listed, let's proceed by checking if there is a tool in another category that might allow us to update files.

I'll list tools in the `repositories` category to see if there is a tool for updating files.
CODE:
# List tools in the repositories category to find tools for updating files
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='repositories')

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_repository_file` and `update_repository_file` tools are available in the `repositories` category, which can be used to create or update files in a repository. Since we need to update the README file, let's get the documentation for the `update_repository_file` tool to understand how to use it.

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `update_repository_file` tool allows us to update a file in a GitLab repository with new content. To update the README file with the list of movies that won Academy Awards by Christopher Nolan, we need the following parameters:

- `project_id`: The ID of the project, which is 198 as obtained from the project creation response.
- `file_path`: The path to the file to be updated, which is "README.md".
- `content`: The new content for the README file.
- `branch`: The branch where the file will be updated, which is "main".
- `commit_message`: A message for the commit.

Let's proceed to update the README file with the required content.
CODE:
# Call the function to update the README file
update_response = call_function(
