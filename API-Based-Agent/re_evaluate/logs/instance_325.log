Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Show me the "mouth night guard" listings by descending price.***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* If the search tool has the suffix 'admin', it returns information about all users. You should find only the information relevant to me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

1. List available tools for the shopping site.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool to search for products.
3. Call the function to search for "mouth night guard" and sort by descending price.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To search for "mouth night guard" listings and sort them by descending price, the `search_products_by_keyword_admin` tool seems appropriate. Let's check its documentation to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_products_by_keyword_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_products_by_keyword_admin.py
'"""\nSearches for products matching a specific keyword, with optional boost value to influence search relevance.\n    \n    Args:\n        keyword (str): The search term to look for in products\n        boost_value (int, optional): Custom boost value to influence search relevance\n    \n    Returns:\n        Returns search results for products matching a specified keyword with optional relevance boosting.\n""" example: search_products_by_keyword("digital watch")'

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_keyword_admin` tool allows us to search for products using a specific keyword. However, the documentation does not mention sorting options directly. To sort the results by descending price, we might need to use another tool or parameter.

Let's explore the `search_products_admin` tool, which might offer more advanced search capabilities, including sorting options. I'll check its documentation next.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_admin', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/search_products_admin.py
'"""\nSearches for products based on specified criteria, with support for pagination, sorting, and field selection.\n    \n    Args:\n        field (str): The product field to search on\n        value (str): The value to search for\n        condition_type (str, optional): The condition type for the search. Defaults to \'eq\'.\n        page_size (int, optional): Maximum number of items to return. Defaults to None.\n        current_page (int, optional): Current page number.

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_admin` tool supports searching for products with various criteria, including sorting options. We can use this tool to search for "mouth night guard" and sort the results by price in descending order.

Let's proceed with calling this function to perform the search and sorting.
CODE:
