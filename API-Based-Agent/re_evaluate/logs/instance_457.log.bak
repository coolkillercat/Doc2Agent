Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Disable Karmen yoga pants from the site, they are facing some quality issues.***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To disable the "Karmen yoga pants," we need to find the appropriate tool to update or disable a product. Based on the available tools, the `create_product_PUT` or `create_product_POST` might be relevant for updating product status. However, we need to confirm which tool is suitable for disabling a product.

Let's check the documentation for the `create_product_PUT` tool to see if it allows us to disable a product.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('create_product_PUT', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/create_product_PUT.py

Defaults to 4.\n        type_id (str, optional): The product type. Defaults to "simple".\n        weight (float, optional): The product weight.

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `create_product_PUT` tool allows us to update a product's status by setting the `status` parameter. To disable a product, we need to set `status` to 2.

Next, we need to find the SKU of the "Karmen yoga pants" to update its status. We can use the `search_products_by_name` tool to find the SKU by searching for the product name.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_products_by_name` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_products_by_name.py
'"""\nSearches for products whose names match a specific pattern using SQL LIKE syntax.\n    \n    Args:\n        name_pattern (str): The pattern to search for in product names (SQL LIKE syntax, % is used as wildcard)\n        page_size (int, optional): Maximum number of items to return\n        current_page (int, optional): Current page of results\n        sort_by (str, optional): Field to sort by\n        sort_direction (str, optional): Sort direction, \'ASC\' or \'DESC\'\n        return_fields (list, optional): List of fields to return in the response\n        \n    Returns:\n        Returns a list of products with their SKUs, names, and prices that match the specified name pattern search criteria.\n""" example: search_products_by_name("%Tee%", page_size=10, sort_by="name", sort_direction="ASC", return_fields=["name", "sku", "price"])'

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_products_by_name` tool allows us to search for products using a name pattern with SQL LIKE syntax. We can use this tool to find the SKU of "Karmen yoga pants" by searching for the name pattern.

Let's search for the "Karmen yoga pants" to find its SKU.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Search for "Karmen yoga pants" to find the SKU
response = call_function('search_products_by_name', site='shopping_admin',
                         name_pattern='%Karmen yoga pants%',
                         return_fields=['name', 'sku'])

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search for "Karmen yoga pants" did not return any results. This could be due to a mismatch in the product name or the product might not exist in the catalog.

Let's try a broader search using a wildcard pattern to see if we can find any similar products. I'll search for products with the name pattern `%Karmen%` to see if we can find any related products.
CODE:
