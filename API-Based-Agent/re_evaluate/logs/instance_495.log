Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping_admin. Answer the question: ***Notify Lily Potter in their most recent pending order with message "Thanks, your order is ready to be shipped!"***
For the shopping admin website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping_admin') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping_admin') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping_admin', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response
5. Note that you should respond with the product name instead of the product id if it's not specified in the task; for customer information, you should respond with the customer name instead of the customer id

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
list_tools(site='shopping_admin')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To proceed with notifying Lily Potter in their most recent pending order, I'll follow these steps:

1. Use the `search_orders_by_status` tool to find Lily Potter's most recent pending order.
2. Use the `add_comment_to_order_POST` tool to add a notification comment to that order.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `search_orders_by_status` tool to understand how to use it to find pending orders for Lily Potter.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_orders_by_status', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping_admin/tools/search_orders_by_status.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_status` tool allows us to search for orders with a specific status, such as 'pending'. We can also sort the results by fields like 'created_at' to find the most recent order. 

Next, I'll use this tool to search for Lily Potter's most recent pending order. I'll sort the results by 'created_at' in descending order to ensure the most recent order is listed first.

Let's proceed with this search.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for Lily Potter's most recent pending order
response = call_function(
    'search_orders_by_status',
    site='shopping_admin',
    status='pending',

}

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the most recent pending order found belongs to Grace Nguyen, not Lily Potter. I need to search specifically for orders placed by Lily Potter.

I'll use the `search_orders_by_customer` tool to find Lily Potter's orders and then filter for the most recent pending one. Let's check the documentation for `search_orders_by_customer` to proceed correctly.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_orders_by_customer', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_orders_by_customer` tool requires a `customer_id` to search for orders placed by a specific customer. Since we need to find orders for Lily Potter, we first need to find her customer ID.

I'll use the `search_customers_GET` tool to find Lily Potter's customer ID. Let's check the documentation for `search_customers_GET` to proceed.
CODE:

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_customers_GET` tool allows us to search for customers based on criteria such as `firstname` and `lastname`. I'll use this tool to find Lily Potter's customer ID by searching with her name.

Let's proceed with this search.

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The most recent order for Lily Potter is in a "canceled" status, not "pending." I need to specifically search for pending orders.

I'll use the `search_orders_by_status` tool again, but this time I'll include a filter for Lily Potter's customer ID to find her pending orders.

Let's proceed with this refined search.
CODE:
# Search for Lily Potter's pending orders
response = call_function(
    'search_orders_with_and_conditions',
    site='shopping_admin',
    filter_groups=[
        {

                {'field': 'customer_id', 'value': 17, 'condition_type': 'eq'},
                {'field': 'status', 'value': 'pending', 'condition_type': 'eq'}
            ]
        }
    ],

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error with the parameters used for the `search_orders_with_and_conditions` tool. I need to adjust the parameters to correctly search for Lily Potter's pending orders.

I'll use the `search_orders_by_status` tool again, but this time I'll include a filter for Lily Potter's customer ID to find her pending orders.

Let's proceed with this refined search.

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: I have found Lily Potter's most recent pending order with the following details:
- Order ID: 303
- Increment ID: 000000303

Now, I'll use the `add_comment_to_order_POST` tool to notify Lily Potter with the message "Thanks, your order is ready to be shipped!" for this order.

Let's proceed with adding the comment to the order.
CODE:
# Add a comment to Lily Potter's most recent pending order
response = call_function(
    'add_comment_to_order_POST',
    site='shopping_admin',
    order_id=303,
    comment="Thanks, your order is ready to be shipped!",
    is_visible_on_front=True
)
response

Step 16:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error with the parameters used for the `add_comment_to_order_POST` tool. I need to check the documentation for this tool to understand the correct parameters.

Let's proceed by checking the documentation for `add_comment_to_order_POST`.
CODE:
get_documentation('add_comment_to_order_POST', site='shopping_admin')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 17:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `add_comment_to_order_POST` tool requires an `id` for the order and a `statusHistory` dictionary containing the comment details. The `statusHistory` should include fields like `comment`, `is_customer_notified`, and `is_visible_on_front`.

Let's proceed with adding the comment to Lily Potter's order using the correct parameters.
