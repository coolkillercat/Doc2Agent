Step 0:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***List all opened issues that report bugs***
For the gitlab website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory) - Lists available tools in a specific category
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='gitlab', category) - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='gitlab', category, **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. get_response(response_id) - Retrieves a stored API response

GitLab tools are organized into categories. Here are the available categories:
- commits
- projects
- groups
- issues
- merge_requests
- users
- repositories
- repository_files
- members
- milestones
- notes
- todos
- runners
- snippets
- epic
- misc
- project_templates

**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
1. NEVER assume or hardcode any parameter values (like project_id). All required parameters can and should be retrieved using the appropriate tools.
2. ALWAYS use project tools first to find project IDs before using tools from other categories.
3. You can list multiple tool categories at once using list_tools(site="gitlab", subdirectory=["commits", "projects"])
4. All values needed for API calls can be obtained through API tools - do not ask users to provide IDs or other parameters.
5. You MUST use <execute_ipython> tags to run Python code, NOT regular code blocks with triple backticks (```). Code blocks with triple backticks will be treated as text messages and will not execute.

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function, get_response
# First, list tools in the projects category to find project ID tools
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='projects')
# Get documentation for a tool to find project ID
get_documentation('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Call the function to find the project ID
projects = call_function('list_projects', site='gitlab', category='projects')
# Extract the project ID for the repository we need
project_id = None
for project in projects['content']:
    if 'repository_name' in project and project['repository_name'] == 'target_repo':
        project_id = project['id']
        break
# Now use the project ID with tools from another category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='commits')
get_documentation('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits')
commit_info = call_function('get_commit', site='gitlab', category='commits', project_id=project_id, commit_sha='main')
</execute_ipython>

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To list all opened issues that report bugs on GitLab, I'll follow these steps:

1. List available tools in the 'issues' category to find the appropriate tool for listing issues.
2. Get documentation for the tool that lists issues to understand the required parameters.
3. Call the function to list issues, filtering for opened issues that report bugs.

Let's start by listing the available tools in the 'issues' category.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
# List available tools in the 'issues' category
list_tools(site='gitlab', subdirectory='issues')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'gitlab'
DEBUG: Looking for GitLab subdirectory tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/issues/tool_description.json
DEBUG: File exists: True
DEBUG: Successfully read tool_description.json for issues
"Available tools in GitLab issues:\n- list_issues_closed_by_merge_request: Retrieves all issues that would be automatically closed if the specified merge request were merged.\n- get_issue_comments: Retrieves all comments for a specific issue to facilitate discussion tracking and team communication.\n- create_todo_for_issue: Creates a to-do item for the current user on a specific issue, helping users track issues they need to address or follow up on.\n- get_milestone_issues: Retrieves all issues assigned to a specific milestone within a project, allowing project managers to track progress and plan work for that milestone.\n- get_issue_discussions: Retrieves all discussion threads and comments for a specific issue within a project, providing a comprehensive view of the conversation history.\n- get_merge_requests_related_to_issue: Retrieves all merge requests that are related to a specific issue in a project, showing their details such as state, author, milestone, and pipeline information.\n- move_issue: Moves an issue from its current project to a different project, transferring all relevant metadata like labels and milestones with matching names.\n- subscribe_to_issue: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_issue_participants: Retrieves a list of users who are participants in a specific GitLab project issue.\n- get_paginated_issues: Retrieve a paginated list of issues from a GitLab group or project.\n- promote_issue_to_epic: Promotes an existing issue to an epic by adding a comment with the /promote quick action.\n- reorder_issue: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_issue_notes: Retrieves all notes for a specific issue in a project, with options to sort and order the results.\n- track_issue_time: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_group_issues: Retrieves issues from a specific group with flexible filtering options.\n- list_issues: Retrieves issues from GitLab with powerful filtering options.\n- update_issue: quote('abc def') -> 'abc%20def'\n\nEach part of a URL, e.g.\n- get_issue_state_events: Retrieves a chronological list of state changes for a specific issue in a project, showing when the issue was opened, closed, or reopened, by whom, and at what time."

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool `list_issues` seems to be the one we need, as it retrieves issues from GitLab with powerful filtering options. Let's proceed by getting the documentation for this tool to understand how to filter for opened issues that report bugs.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
# Get documentation for the 'list_issues' tool
get_documentation('list_issues', site='gitlab', category='issues')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/gitlab/tools/issues/list_issues.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `list_issues` tool allows us to filter issues by various parameters, including state and labels. To list all opened issues that report bugs, we can use the `state` parameter set to `'opened'` and the `labels` parameter to filter for issues labeled as bugs.

Let's proceed to call the `list_issues` function with these parameters.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Call the function to list opened issues that report bugs
issues = call_function('list_issues', site='gitlab', category='issues', state='opened', labels='bug')
