CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to shopping. Answer the question: ***Fill the "contact us" form in the site for a refund on the speaker I bought, stating that it broke after just three days of use. Also, ensure to include the order number #148 and the product SKU. Don't submit yet, I will check.***
For the shopping website, use the following tools to interact with the API:

1. list_tools(site='shopping') - Lists all available API tools
2. get_documentation(tool_name, site='shopping') - Shows documentation for a specific tool
3. call_function(tool_name, site='shopping', **kwargs) - Calls the tool with keyword arguments
4. call_direct(method, url, headers, body, site='shopping') - For PUT/DELETE operations

Example workflow:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function
list_tools(site='shopping')
</execute_ipython>

*Note that I am Emma Lopez, and my email is emma.lopez@gmail.com.* You should use these information if the task asks about *me*, and you should filter out information about me if the task asks about anything related to me.

For tasks involving shopping carts, you must first create a shopping cart using the appropriate cart creation tool before checking carts or adding products. Always use the tools for cart operations instead of direct URL manipulation.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to browse the web directly for shopping operations. Instead, ALWAYS use the API tools provided through the `list_tools`, `get_documentation`, and `call_function` utilities. Web browsing will not work for these tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** You should use the API tools provided rather than attempting to browse the web directly. Direct web browsing will not work properly for these tasks.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
