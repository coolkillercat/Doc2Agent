For each GlyTouCan ID obtained, use 'obtain_wurcs_and_glycoct_from_glytoucan_id' to get the corresponding WURCS and GlycoCT sequence representations. Identify novel structural features by comparing retrieved sequences.",

    "reasoning": "The agent attempted to address the research question by using the appropriate sequence of glycan APIs, starting with the `partial_match_wurcs_rdf_GET` tool to find glycan structures that partially match the given WURCS format text. It successfully retrieved a list of GlyTouCan IDs and their corresponding WURCS representations. However, the agent encountered issues when attempting to retrieve the WURCS and GlycoCT sequences for these IDs using the `obtain_wurcs_and_glycoct_from_glytoucan_id_POST` tool. The agent initially used an incorrect parameter name (`glytoucan_id` instead of `gtcid`), which led to an error. After correcting the parameter, the agent successfully retrieved the sequences for one ID (G48061MK) but did not complete the task for the remaining IDs (G51197ZR and G44161QY) due to an error state.",
    "critical_issues": "The agent did not complete the retrieval of WURCS and GlycoCT sequences for all GlyTouCan IDs, which was a key part of the research question. Additionally, the agent did not perform the comparison of retrieved sequences to identify novel structural features, which was explicitly requested.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results obtained for the ID G48061MK appears to be correct, as the agent provided both WURCS and GlycoCT sequences. However, the task was incomplete, and no novel structural features were identified or discussed.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent demonstrated a logical workflow by starting with tool discovery and checking documentation. It handled the initial error with parameter naming by consulting the documentation, which is a good practice. However, the agent failed to complete the task due to an error state and did not attempt to resolve it or continue with the remaining IDs. The agent's workflow was interrupted, and it did not synthesize the results into a meaningful conclusion as required by the research question.",
