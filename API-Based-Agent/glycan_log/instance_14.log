THOUGHT: The `get_feature_by_locations_GET` tool allows us to search for UniProt entries by specifying the taxonomy and genomic coordinates. We can set the `in_range` parameter to `True` to ensure that only entries fully within the specified range are retrieved. The response format can be set to `json`.

Let's proceed to call this function with the specified parameters: taxonomy ID for Homo sapiens (9606), genomic coordinates on chromosome X from 58205437 to 58219305, and a maximum of 100 records.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Call the get_feature_by_locations_GET function with the specified parameters
response = call_function(
    'get_feature_by_locations_GET',
    site='glycan',
    module='swaggerProteinAPI',
    taxonomy='9606',
    locations='x:58205437-58219305',
    in_range=True,
    size=100,
    format='json'
)

print(response)

CONTENT: Please continue working on the glycan research task using the available APIs.
IMPORTANT: You MUST write Python code in <execute_ipython> blocks to call the glycan functions!

CRITICAL GLYCAN WORKFLOW:
1. ALWAYS start by exploring available APIs using list_tools(site="glycan") for modules
2. ALWAYS examine API documentation using get_documentation(tool_name, site="glycan", module="module_name")
3. ALWAYS use call_function(tool_name, site="glycan", module="module_name", **parameters) for API calls
4. Make sure to verify your results and provide clear explanations

EXAMPLE CODE FORMAT:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function
result = list_tools(site="glycan")
print(result)
</execute_ipython>

When you think you successfully finished the research task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the research question in `[]`. Make sure to include all relevant findings and scientific conclusions.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>

THOUGHT: Since the previous attempt to retrieve protein features within the specified genomic range returned no results, let's ensure that we have explored all possible tools and modules that might be relevant to the task. We have already explored the `swaggerProteinAPI` module, which seemed the most relevant. However, let's double-check if there are any other modules or tools that might provide additional insights or data related to glycan research.

Let's start by listing all available tools in the `glygen` module, which might also contain relevant data for protein-glycan interactions or features.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools

# List tools in the glygen module
tools_glygen = list_tools(site='glycan', module='glygen')
print(tools_glygen)
2025-06-16 18:23:05,926 - opendevin - INFO - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
Available tools in glycan module "glygen":
- glycan_detail_POST: Retrieve comprehensive details about a specific glycan from the GlyGen database using its GlyTouCan accession number, including chemical properties, biological associations, and cross-references.
- protein_detail_POST: Obtain detailed information about a protein from the GlyGen database using its UniProt accession number, focusing on glycosylation sites, disease associations, and structural characteristics.
