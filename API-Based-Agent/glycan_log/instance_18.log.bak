THOUGHT: To address the research question, we need to find the genomic coordinates of the genes BRCA1 and TP53 in Homo sapiens. However, the glycan research APIs provided do not directly relate to genomic data. These APIs are specialized for glycan-related research, such as glycan structure validation, protein-glycan interactions, and glycan format conversions.

Since the task requires genomic information, which is outside the scope of the glycan APIs, we would typically use genomic databases or APIs like Ensembl, NCBI, or UCSC Genome Browser for such data. However, given the constraints, I'll proceed with the available tools to demonstrate the process of exploring the glycan APIs.

Let's start by listing the available tools in the glycan site to see if there might be any unexpected resources that could help with genomic data, although it's unlikely.

THOUGHT: To address the research question regarding the genomic coordinates of the genes BRCA1 and TP53 in Homo sapiens, we need to access genomic data rather than glycan-specific data. However, since we are working within the glycan research API environment, I'll first explore the available tools to see if any module might provide relevant genomic information or if we need to consider alternative approaches.

Let's start by listing all available modules and tools within the glycan research environment to determine if any can assist with genomic data retrieval.

IMPORTANT: You MUST write Python code in <execute_ipython> blocks to call the glycan functions!

CRITICAL GLYCAN WORKFLOW:
1. ALWAYS start by exploring available APIs using list_tools(site="glycan") for modules
2. ALWAYS examine API documentation using get_documentation(tool_name, site="glycan", module="module_name")
3. ALWAYS use call_function(tool_name, site="glycan", module="module_name", **parameters) for API calls
4. Make sure to verify your results and provide clear explanations

<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function
result = list_tools(site="glycan")
print(result)

When you think you successfully finished the research task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the research question in `[]`. Make sure to include all relevant findings and scientific conclusions.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
