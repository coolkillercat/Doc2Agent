Convert the provided IUPAC Extended format to WURCS format using the `convert_iupac_extended_to_wurcs` tool.\n2. Generate an image of the glycan structure using the `generate_glycan_image` tool with the output WURCS from step 1.\n3. Validate the generated WURCS format using the `validate_wurcs` tool to check for any errors or warnings. \n\nDocument each step with the outputs obtained from the tools.",

    "reasoning": "The agent attempted to follow the expected trajectory but encountered several issues that prevented it from successfully completing the task. The agent correctly identified the necessary modules and tools for each step of the task, starting with the conversion of the IUPAC Extended format to WURCS. The conversion was successful, and the agent retrieved the WURCS format and GlyTouCan accession ID. However, the agent faced persistent issues when attempting to generate an image of the glycan structure. The initial attempt to handle the binary response failed due to a decoding error, and subsequent attempts to retrieve the image data in JSON format also resulted in errors. The agent did not successfully generate or save the glycan image, which was a critical part of the task. Additionally, the agent did not proceed to validate the WURCS format, which was the final step in the expected trajectory.",
    "critical_issues": "1. Failure to generate and save the glycan image due to mishandling of binary and JSON responses. 2. Incomplete task execution as the WURCS validation step was not reached.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the conversion from IUPAC Extended to WURCS was correct, as evidenced by the successful retrieval of the WURCS format and GlyTouCan ID. However, the failure to generate the glycan image and validate the WURCS format means that the task was not fully completed, limiting the scientific insights that could be drawn from the results.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent correctly identified and used the appropriate tools for the initial conversion step. However, it struggled with handling the binary response for image generation, which indicates a lack of robustness in dealing with different response types. The agent's workflow was logical up to the point of the image generation step, but it did not handle errors gracefully or adapt effectively to resolve the issues encountered. The agent also failed to proceed to the WURCS validation step, which was a necessary part of the task.",
