  "question": "Considering the glycan structure represented in WURCS format 'WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1', generate a visual image of the glycan and then validate the WURCS notation for accuracy. The research task is aligned towards creating reliable visual datasets of glycan structures that are validated as per scientific standards. Use 'generate_glycan_image' to create an image in 'png' format with 'html' response type and use 'validate_wurcs' to ensure the WURCS notation is correctly formatted and free of errors.",

    "decision": "SUCCESS",
    "success": true,
    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by generating a visual image of the glycan structure and validating the WURCS notation. The agent followed a logical sequence of API calls, starting with tool discovery and documentation retrieval, which is consistent with best practices in glycomics research. The agent correctly identified and used the `generate_glycan_image_POST` tool from the `glycanimage` module to create the glycan image and the `validate_wurcs_POST` tool from the `wurcsframework` module to validate the WURCS notation. The agent handled an error gracefully by correcting the parameter name and successfully generating the glycan image. The validation results confirmed that the WURCS notation was correctly formatted with no errors or warnings, ensuring the scientific accuracy of the task.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific validity of the results is high. The agent correctly interpreted the WURCS format and ensured that the glycan structure was accurately represented and validated. The validation confirmed the correctness of the WURCS notation, which is crucial for reliable glycan datasets.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used appropriate tools and followed a logical workflow. The agent started with tool discovery, retrieved necessary documentation, and executed the correct API calls to achieve the research objectives. The agent also demonstrated the ability to handle errors and adjust the approach as needed, which is indicative of a robust research workflow.",
