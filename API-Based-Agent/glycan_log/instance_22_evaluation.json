    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by using the appropriate sequence of glycan APIs to address the research question. The agent correctly identified the relevant tool, `get_fungal_lectins_POST`, from the UniLectin module to retrieve data on fungal lectins from the species 'Aspergillus niger'. The agent followed a logical workflow by first listing available modules, identifying the relevant tool, checking its documentation, and then executing the API call with the correct parameters to obtain the desired data. The agent retrieved and presented a comprehensive list of structural folds and domains associated with 'Aspergillus niger', which aligns with the research question's requirements.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The results obtained are scientifically valid and meaningful for glycomics research. The agent accurately retrieved and interpreted the structural folds and domains of fungal lectins from 'Aspergillus niger', providing a detailed overview of the structural diversity involved in glycan recognition and binding. The data presented is consistent with known biochemical structures and domains.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the appropriate tools and followed a logical workflow. It started with tool discovery, used documentation to understand the API's functionality, and executed the API call with the correct parameters. The agent handled the data retrieval process effectively, ensuring that the results were limited to 1000 entries as specified in the research question. The agent's approach was consistent with best practices in glycomics research, demonstrating a clear understanding of the task requirements and the available resources.",
