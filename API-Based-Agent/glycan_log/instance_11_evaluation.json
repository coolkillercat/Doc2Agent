    "decision": "SUCCESS",
    "success": true,
    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by using the appropriate API from the UniLectin module to retrieve information about the lectin fold and domain types of fungal lectins in 'Candida albicans'. The agent followed a logical workflow, starting with tool discovery and then using the `get_fungal_lectins_POST` function to obtain the necessary data. The agent correctly specified the parameters to filter the results by species and limit the number of entries, which aligns with the research question's requirements. The final response provided a clear summary of the lectin fold and domain types, demonstrating a proper understanding of the data retrieved.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is high. The agent correctly identified and interpreted the lectin fold and domain types for 'Candida albicans', providing meaningful insights into the glycomics research question. The data retrieved from the UniLectin database was accurately summarized, and the agent demonstrated a proper understanding of the biochemical context.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the appropriate tools and followed a logical workflow. The agent began with tool discovery, checked the documentation for the relevant API, and executed the API call with the correct parameters. The workflow was consistent with glycomics best practices, and the agent handled the task efficiently without errors. The integration of data from the API call was seamless, and the results were synthesized into a coherent final response.",
