The agent correctly identified and used the `convert_gws_format_to_wurcs_format_POST` tool from the `glycosmos-otherapis` module to convert the GWS formatted glycan to WURCS format. However, when attempting to retrieve the GlyTouCan ID using the `obtain_glytoucan_id_from_wurcs_POST` tool from the `glytoucandata` module, the agent received a response indicating \"Accession not found.\" This suggests that the glycan structure might not be registered in the GlyTouCan database, but the agent did not explore alternative approaches or verify the WURCS format's registration status in other databases. The agent's workflow was logical and followed the expected trajectory, but it did not achieve the research objective of obtaining the GlyTouCan ID.",
