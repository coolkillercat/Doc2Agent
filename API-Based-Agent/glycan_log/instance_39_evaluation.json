  "question": "Investigate the role of Siglecs (Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectins) in human diseases by identifying curated Siglecs and retrieving detailed protein information, including disease associations.\n\n1. Use `get_human_lectome` to retrieve UniProt IDs for Siglecs with curated lectin status: call `get_human_lectome(getcolumns=\"RefSeqID,UniProt_ID\", wherecolumn=\"common_protein_name\", isvalue=\"%SIGLEC%\", limit=1000)`.\n2. For each UniProt ID obtained, use `protein_detail` to get detailed information about the protein: call `protein_detail(uniprot_canonical_ac='<UniProt_ID>')` using the UniProt_ID from step 1.",

    "reasoning": "The agent failed to complete the research task due to several issues in the API usage and workflow. Initially, the agent correctly identified the need to use the `get_human_lectome` function to retrieve UniProt IDs for Siglecs, which was a good start. However, the agent encountered an SSL certificate error when attempting to use the `protein_detail_POST` function to retrieve detailed protein information, including disease associations. This error was not resolved, and the agent's attempt to bypass SSL verification was unsuccessful due to the limitations of the `call_function` utility. Consequently, the agent was unable to obtain the detailed protein information required to answer the research question. The agent did not explore alternative methods or tools to overcome the SSL issue, such as using other available APIs or external resources to gather the necessary data. Additionally, the agent did not attempt to manually verify or troubleshoot the SSL issue, which could have been a potential workaround.",
    "critical_issues": "The major problem was the inability to retrieve detailed protein information due to an SSL certificate error, which the agent did not resolve or work around effectively.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results could not be fully assessed because the agent did not obtain the necessary data to provide a complete answer. The initial retrieval of UniProt IDs was correct, but without further protein details, the scientific insights were incomplete.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent initially used appropriate tools to retrieve UniProt IDs but failed to follow through with the necessary steps to obtain detailed protein information. The agent did not handle the SSL error gracefully and did not explore alternative approaches to complete the task. The workflow lacked robustness in error handling and adaptability to unforeseen issues.",
