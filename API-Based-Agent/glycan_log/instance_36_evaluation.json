First, convert this glycan composition text to the WURCS format using the `convert_composition_text_to_wurcs_format` tool. Next, calculate the molecular mass of the glycan using the WURCS format obtained by the `calculate_mass_from_wurcs` tool.",

    "reasoning": "The agent failed to successfully complete the research task of determining the molecular mass of the glycan specified by the composition 'Hex(3)HexNAc(2)'. The agent correctly identified the need to convert the glycan composition to WURCS format and attempted to use the appropriate API tools. However, the agent encountered multiple errors during the process, particularly in handling the WURCS format and calculating the molecular mass. The agent's attempts to extract and use the WURCS format were unsuccessful due to errors in parsing and string manipulation, leading to a failure in obtaining the molecular mass.",
    "critical_issues": "1. The agent encountered a `TypeError` and a `JSONDecodeError` when attempting to handle the WURCS format, indicating issues with data extraction and manipulation. 2. The agent was unable to successfully calculate the molecular mass due to these errors, resulting in an incomplete task.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results could not be assessed because the agent did not successfully complete the task. The agent's initial steps were scientifically valid, but the errors in data handling prevented the completion of the task.",

However, the agent struggled with data extraction and manipulation, leading to errors that prevented successful completion. The agent's workflow was logical, but the execution was flawed due to technical issues in handling the API responses.",
