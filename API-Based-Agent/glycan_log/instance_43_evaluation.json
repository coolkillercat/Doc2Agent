  "question": "How can we validate the glycan structure and readiness for glycosylation of the compound represented by the WURCS string 'WURCS=2.0/3,5,4/[a2122h-1b_1-5_2*NCC/3=O][a1122h-1b_1-5][a1122h-1a_1-5]/1-1-2-3-3/a4-b1_b4-c1_c3-d1_c6-e1', and represent it visually? \n\n1. Use the `validate_wurcs` tool with the given WURCS string to verify and standardized format.\n2. Use `generate_glycan_image` to produce a visual representation of the glycan in PNG format from the validated WURCS string.\n3. Use `validate_composition_for_glycosylation` to confirm if the validated WURCS composition is suitable for glycosylation.",

    "reasoning": "The agent attempted to follow the expected API trajectory but encountered significant issues that prevented successful completion of the task. The agent correctly identified and used the `validate_wurcs_POST` tool to validate the WURCS string, confirming its correctness with no errors or warnings. However, the agent faced persistent issues when attempting to generate a glycan image using the `generate_glycan_image_POST` tool. The agent initially attempted to handle the response as binary data, which resulted in a decoding error. Despite switching to an HTML response type and successfully retrieving a base64-encoded image, the agent's workflow was disrupted by these errors, leading to a failure in seamlessly integrating the image generation step. The agent did successfully validate the composition for glycosylation using the `validate_composition_for_glycosylation_POST` tool, confirming the glycan's readiness for glycosylation. However, the inability to generate and present the glycan image as requested is a critical shortcoming.",
    "critical_issues": "The main issue was the failure to handle the binary response for the glycan image generation, which led to an incomplete task. The agent's attempts to resolve this by switching response types were not fully successful, as the image was not presented in the final output.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results obtained was generally sound. The agent correctly validated the WURCS string and confirmed the glycan's readiness for glycosylation. However, the failure to generate and present the glycan image limits the completeness of the scientific output.",

The workflow was logical, but the agent struggled with error handling during the image generation step, which affected the overall success of the task.
