Filter results to only include entries with active cross references from the RefSeq database associated with human taxonomy (TaxId 9606), and return the data in JSON format.",

    "success": true,
    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by retrieving the UniParc entries associated with the RefSeq accession 'XP_006524055'. The agent followed a logical sequence of steps to identify and use the appropriate API tool, `get_uniparc_entries_by_cross_reference_accessions_GET`, from the `swaggerProteinAPI` module. The agent correctly applied the necessary filters to ensure the results were specific to human taxonomy (TaxId 9606) and included only active cross-references from the RefSeq database. The final JSON output provided detailed information about the UniParc entry, including protein domains and sequence data, which aligns with the research question's requirements. The agent demonstrated a good understanding of the research workflow by starting with tool discovery, consulting documentation, and handling the API call effectively. Although there was an SSL error when attempting to use the `protein_detail_POST` tool from the `glygen` module, this did not impact the primary task completion, as the main objective was already achieved.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific validity of the results is sound. The agent accurately retrieved and interpreted the UniParc entry data, including protein domains and sequence information, which are relevant for glycomics research. The use of database cross-references was appropriate and correctly filtered for human-specific data.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the appropriate tools and followed a logical workflow. The choice of the `swaggerProteinAPI` module and the specific API tool was correct for the task. The agent effectively utilized the API documentation to understand the parameters needed for the API call and applied them correctly to obtain the desired results. The agent also demonstrated the ability to handle errors gracefully, although the SSL error did not affect the primary task outcome.",
