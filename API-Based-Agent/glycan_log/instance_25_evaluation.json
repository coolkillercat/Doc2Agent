  "task_id": 25,
  "question": "Investigate the post-translational modifications specifically phosphorylation occurring in phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) protein across both Homo sapiens (human) and Mus musculus (mouse). Use the UniProt accession numbers 'P00558' for human and 'P52480' for mouse, and filter results from the data sources PRIDE and PTMExchange with a PTM confidence score of Gold.",
  "expected_trajectory": "search_proteomics_peptide_ptm",
  "agent_response": "Agent completed with state: State",
  "evaluation_result": {
    "decision": "SUCCESS",
    "success": true,
    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by using the appropriate API to gather phosphorylation data for the PGK1 protein in both Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. The agent followed a logical workflow by first identifying the available tools in the `swaggerProteinAPI` module and then using the `get_proteomics_peptide_ptm_GET` tool to retrieve post-translational modification data. The agent correctly filtered the results to include only those with a \"Gold\" confidence score, as specified in the research question. The agent provided a clear and accurate summary of the findings, noting the absence of phosphorylation sites in the human PGK1 protein and identifying several phosphorylation sites in the mouse PGK1 protein. The agent's approach was scientifically valid, and the results were meaningful for glycomics research.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific validity of the results is high. The agent accurately interpreted the phosphorylation data and provided meaningful insights into the post-translational modifications of the PGK1 protein in both species. The use of confidence scores to filter the data ensured that the findings were reliable.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used the appropriate tools within the `swaggerProteinAPI` module and followed a logical research workflow. The agent started with tool discovery, used documentation to understand the API parameters, and executed the API calls effectively. The agent's workflow was consistent with glycomics best practices, and the data integration was handled well, leading to a coherent synthesis of the results.",
