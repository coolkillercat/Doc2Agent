  "task_id": 21,
  "question": "What protein sequence features related to glycosylation can be identified in reviewed proteins of human hemoglobin (Homo sapiens) using the UniProt accession numbers P69905 and P68871? Consider only features categorized under POST_TRANSLATIONAL_MODIFICATIONS and types inclusive of CARBOHYD.",
  "expected_trajectory": "search_protein_sequence_features",
  "agent_response": "Agent completed with state: State",
  "evaluation_result": {
    "decision": "SUCCESS",
    "success": true,
    "reasoning": "The agent successfully completed the research task by identifying glycosylation-related features in the reviewed human hemoglobin proteins with UniProt accession numbers P69905 and P68871. The agent used the `swaggerProteinAPI` module, specifically the `get_uniprot_protein_sequence_features_by_accession_GET` tool, to retrieve protein sequence features related to glycosylation. This approach aligns with the expected trajectory of searching for protein sequence features, focusing on POST_TRANSLATIONAL_MODIFICATIONS and CARBOHYD types. The agent correctly identified glycosylation sites and provided evidence from scientific literature, demonstrating a proper understanding of the task requirements.",
    "critical_issues": "None",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy of the results is high. The agent correctly identified glycosylation sites on specific residues of the hemoglobin proteins and provided evidence from PubMed articles, which supports the validity of the findings. The interpretation of glycosylation as N-linked glycation at specific lysine and valine residues is consistent with known biochemical processes.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent used appropriate tools from the `swaggerProteinAPI` module to address the research question. The workflow was logical, starting with tool discovery, checking documentation, and executing the correct API calls to retrieve the necessary data. The agent effectively handled the data retrieval and interpretation, leading to a successful completion of the task.",
