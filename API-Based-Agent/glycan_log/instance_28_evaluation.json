The agent's interaction log shows repeated attempts to list available glycan modules without progressing to the actual task of querying the relevant database for the required protein information. The agent did not utilize the expected API trajectory, `search_gene_centric_proteins`, or any alternative scientifically valid approach to address the research question. Instead, it got stuck in a loop of listing available modules, indicating a failure to proceed with the task.",

The agent also failed to identify and use the appropriate tools from the available modules to perform the required protein search.",
    "scientific_accuracy": "The scientific accuracy cannot be assessed as the agent did not retrieve or analyze any data related to the research question. There was no interpretation of glycan structures, protein-glycan interactions, or database cross-references.",
    "api_usage_assessment": "The agent did not use the appropriate tools or follow a logical workflow to address the research question. It failed to move beyond the initial step of listing available modules and did not attempt to use the SwaggerProteinAPI or any other relevant module to search for gene-centric proteins. The agent's workflow was not consistent with glycomics best practices, as it did not progress to tool discovery or documentation usage for the specific task at hand.",
