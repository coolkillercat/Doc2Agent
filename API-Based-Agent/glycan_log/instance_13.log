RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the trefoil lectins found in the superkingdom of Bacteria analyzed by the domain, uniprot, and superkingdom fields? Retrieve a maximum of 2000 entries from the UniLectin database.

You have access to 12 specialized glycan API modules:
- WURCSFramework: Structure validation and mass calculation
- GlycanFormatConverter: Format conversions (IUPAC, WURCS, etc.)
- GlyGen: Protein-glycan interaction data
- UniLectin: Lectin-glycan binding analysis
- PubChem: Chemical properties and bioassays
- SwaggerProteinAPI: Comprehensive protein analysis
- GlyTouCanData: Glycan registry and identification
- GlycanImage: Glycan structure visualization
- GlycoSMOS-OtherAPIs: Multi-format conversion tools
- Composition: Composition-based analysis
- KEGG: Pathway and metabolic context
- O-GlcNAc: Specific PTM analysis

CRITICAL WORKFLOW:
1. Start with list_tools(site='glycan') to see all available modules
2. Use list_tools(site='glycan', module='MODULE_NAME') to see tools in specific modules
3. Use get_documentation(tool_name, site='glycan', module='MODULE_NAME') for tool details
4. Use call_function(tool_name, site='glycan', module='MODULE_NAME', **parameters) to execute APIs

IMPORTANT: You MUST use Python code blocks to call these functions. Always format your code as:

<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function

# Example calls:
result = list_tools(site='glycan')
print(result)

# For specific modules:
tools = list_tools(site='glycan', module='GlycanFormatConverter')
print(tools)

# For documentation:
doc = get_documentation('convert_iupac_to_wurcs', site='glycan', module='GlycanFormatConverter')
print(doc)

# For function calls:
response = call_function('convert_iupac_to_wurcs', site='glycan', module='GlycanFormatConverter', iupac_string='your_input')
print(response)
</execute_ipython>

Remember: Always specify both site='glycan' and module='MODULE_NAME' when calling glycan functions.

CONTENT: Please continue working on the glycan research task using the available APIs.
IMPORTANT: You MUST write Python code in <execute_ipython> blocks to call the glycan functions!

CRITICAL GLYCAN WORKFLOW:
1. ALWAYS start by exploring available APIs using list_tools(site="glycan") for modules
2. ALWAYS examine API documentation using get_documentation(tool_name, site="glycan", module="module_name")
3. ALWAYS use call_function(tool_name, site="glycan", module="module_name", **parameters) for API calls
4. Make sure to verify your results and provide clear explanations

EXAMPLE CODE FORMAT:
<execute_ipython>
from utils import list_tools, get_documentation, call_function
result = list_tools(site="glycan")
print(result)
</execute_ipython>

When you think you successfully finished the research task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the research question in `[]`. Make sure to include all relevant findings and scientific conclusions.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
