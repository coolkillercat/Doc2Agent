  "question": "Investigate potential lectin-glycan interactions from bacterial lectins and obtain proteomics data for these lectins by performing the following sequence of tasks. First, retrieve lectin data from the UniLectin database for bacterial proteins. Use the 'get_predicted_lectins' function with the parameters: `getcolumns=\"fold,domain,uniprot,superkingdom\"`, `wherecolumn=\"superkingdom\"`, `isvalue=\"Bacteria%\"`, and `limit=10`. From the returned results, extract the UniProt accessions. Next, use these accessions to get proteomics peptides by calling the 'get_proteomics_peptides_by_accession' function, passing each UniProt accession one at a time as the `accession` parameter. This will allow us to connect predicted bacterial lectins to their peptide features at the proteomics level, potentially revealing new insights into lectin functions.",

    "reasoning": "The agent did not successfully complete the research task. The primary objective was to retrieve lectin data from the UniLectin database and obtain proteomics data for these lectins. The agent encountered several issues that prevented it from achieving this goal. Initially, the agent attempted to use the `get_predicted_lectins_POST` function from the UniLectin module, but it failed due to a missing dependency (`pandas`). This error was not resolved, and the agent did not attempt to fix the dependency issue or find an alternative method to retrieve the predicted lectins. Subsequently, the agent attempted to use the `search_uniprot_entries_GET` function to find bacterial lectins, but the response was empty, indicating a potential issue with the search criteria. The agent then tried using the `search_protein_sequence_features_GET` function to find protein sequence features related to lectins, which returned some UniProt accessions. However, when the agent attempted to retrieve proteomics data for these accessions using the `get_proteomics_peptides_by_accession_GET` function, it encountered a 404 error, indicating that the accession might be obsolete. Overall, the agent did not manage to retrieve the necessary lectin data or proteomics information, and the workflow was not completed as intended.",

Encountering a 404 error when attempting to retrieve proteomics data, indicating potential issues with the UniProt accessions used.",
