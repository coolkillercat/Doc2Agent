    """
    Get proteins by proteome UPID from the EBI API.
    
    Args:
        upid (str): UniProt Proteome UPID. Required. Format should match UP[0-9]{9}.
        reviewed (str, optional): Filter for reviewed proteins. 
                                 Set to 'true' for reviewed proteins only, 
                                 'false' for unreviewed proteins only.
    
    Returns:
        Returns protein information for a specified proteome identified by its UniProt Proteome ID (UPID), with optional filtering for reviewed or unreviewed proteins.
    Examples:
        >>> response = get_proteins_by_proteome_upid(upid='UP000005640', reviewed='true')
        >>> response = get_proteins_by_proteome_upid(upid='UP000005640')
