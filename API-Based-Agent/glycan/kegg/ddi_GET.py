    """
    Find adverse drug-drug interactions from the KEGG database.
    
    This function queries the KEGG API to find drug-drug interactions designated as 
    contraindication (CI) and precaution (P) in Japanese drug labels.
    
    Args:
        dbentry (str): A single drug entry identifier (e.g., 'D00564').
        multiple_entries (list, optional): A list of drug identifiers to check for interactions
                                          between them (e.g., ['D00564', 'D00100']).
    
    Returns:
        Returns adverse drug-drug interactions designated as contraindication (CI) and precaution (P) in Japanese drug labels for specified drug entries.
    Examples:
        >>> response = ddi(dbentry='D00564')  # Get all interactions for a single drug
        >>> response = ddi(multiple_entries=['D00564', 'D00100', 'D00109'])  # Check interactions between drugs
