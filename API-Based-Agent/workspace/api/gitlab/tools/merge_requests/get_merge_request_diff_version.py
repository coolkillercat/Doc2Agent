    """
    Retrieves a specific version of a merge request diff, including commit details and file changes.
    
    This function fetches a single merge request diff version with all its details including commits,
    file changes, and metadata. Useful for code review workflows and tracking how a merge request 
    has evolved over time.
    
    Args:
        project_id (str): ID of the project (e.g., "183")
        merge_request_iid (int): Internal ID of the merge request (e.g., 1)
        version_id (int): ID of the merge request diff version (e.g., 1)
        unidiff (bool, optional): Whether to present diffs in unified diff format. Defaults to False.
    
    Returns:
        requests.Response: The API response containing the merge request diff version data
        
    Example:
        >>> response = get_merge_request_diff_version("183", 1, 1)
        >>> response = get_merge_request_diff_version("183", 1, 1, unidiff=True)
