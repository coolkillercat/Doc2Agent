The site URL for map is http://miniserver1875.asuscomm.com:3000, use this instead of the normal map URL. 
For web browsing, You should start from the URL http://miniserver1875.asuscomm.com:3000, and this webpage is already logged in and opened for you.
For the map website, you will be provided with three sets of APIs, each providing different functionalities; However, if you are using Web Browsing, you should always start from the URL `http://miniserver1875.asuscomm.com:3000` - Be aware of this differences.


Below is the list of all APIs you can use and their descriptions:
Below is all the documentation on how to use the http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:{profile}/{service}/v1/test/ endpoints.
# OSRM HTTP Router

## General options

All OSRM HTTP requests use a common structure.

The following syntax applies to all services, except as noted.

### Requests

```endpoint
GET http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:{profile}/{service}/v1/test/{coordinates}[.{format}]?option=value&option=value
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `profile` | Mode of transportation. One of the following three values: `5000` for car (driving), `5001` for bicycle (biking), and `5002` for foot (walking). |
| `service` | One of the following values: [`route`](#route-service), [`nearest`](#nearest-service), [`table`](#table-service), [`match`](#match-service), [`trip`](#trip-service), [`tile`](#tile-service) |
| `coordinates`| String of format `{longitude},{latitude};{longitude},{latitude}[;{longitude},{latitude} ...]` or `polyline({polyline}) or polyline6({polyline6})`. |
| `format`| `json` or `flatbuffers`. This parameter is optional and defaults to `json`. |

Passing any `option=value` is optional. `polyline` follows Google's polyline format with precision 5 by default and can be generated using [this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyline).

To pass parameters to each location some options support an array-like encoding:

**Request options**

| Option         | Values                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|skip_waypoints  |`true`, `false` (default)                               |Removes waypoints from the response. Waypoints are still calculated, but not serialized. Could be useful in case you are interested in some other part of the response and do not want to transfer waste data. |

Where the elements follow the following format:

| Element    | Values                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|bearing     |`{value},{range}` `integer 0 .. 360,integer 0 .. 180`   |
|radius      |`double >= 0` or `unlimited` (default)                  |
|hint        |Base64 `string`                                         |
|approach    |`curb`, `opposite` or `unrestricted` (default)          |
|class       |A class name determined by the profile or `none`.       |

```
{option}={element};{element}[;{element} ... ]
```

The number of elements must match exactly the number of locations (except for `generate_hints` and `exclude`). If you don't want to pass a value but instead use the default you can pass an empty `element`.

Example: 2nd location uses the default value for `option`:

```
{option}={element};;{element}
```

#### Example Requests

```curl
# Query on Berlin with three coordinates:
curl 'http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:5000/route/v1/test/13.388860,52.517037;13.397634,52.529407;13.428555,52.523219?overview=false'

```

### Responses

#### Code

Every response object has a `code` property containing one of the strings below or a service dependent code:

| Type              | Description                                                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Ok`              | Request could be processed as expected.                                          |
| `InvalidUrl`      | URL string is invalid.                                                           |
| `InvalidService`  | Service name is invalid.                                                         |
| `InvalidVersion`  | Version is not found.                                                            |
| `InvalidOptions`  | Options are invalid.                                                             |
| `InvalidQuery`    | The query string is syntactically malformed.                                     |
| `InvalidValue`    | The successfully parsed query parameters are invalid.                            |
| `NoSegment`       | One of the supplied input coordinates could not snap to the street segment.      |
| `TooBig`          | The request size violates one of the service-specific request size restrictions. |
| `DisabledDataset` | The request tried to access a disabled dataset.                                  |

- `message` is a **optional** human-readable error message. All other status types are service-dependent.
- In case of an error the HTTP status code will be `400`. Otherwise, the HTTP status code will be `200` and `code` will be `Ok`.

#### Data version

Every response object has a `data_version` property containing a timestamp from the original OpenStreetMap file. This field is optional. 

#### Example response

```json
{
"code": "Ok",
"message": "Everything worked",
"data_version": "2017-11-17T21:43:02Z"
}
```


## Services

### Nearest service

Snaps a coordinate to the street network and returns the nearest `n` matches.

```endpoint
GET http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:{profile}/nearest/v1/test/{coordinates}.json?number={number}
```

Where `coordinates` only supports a single `{longitude},{latitude}` entry.

In addition to the [general options](#general-options) the following options are supported for this service:

|Option      |Values                        |Description                                         |
|------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|number      |`integer >= 1` (default `1`)  |Number of nearest segments that should be returned. |

As `waypoints` is a single thing, returned by that service, using it with the option `skip_waypoints` set to `true` is quite useless, but still
possible. In that case, only the `code` field will be returned.

**Response**

- `code` if the request was successful `Ok` otherwise see the service dependent and general status codes.
- `waypoints` array of `Waypoint` objects sorted by distance to the input coordinate. Each object has at least the following additional properties:
  - `nodes`: Array of OpenStreetMap node ids.

#### Example Requests

```curl
# Querying nearest three snapped locations of `13.388860,52.517037` with a bearing between `20° - 340°`.
curl 'http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:5000/nearest/v1/test/13.388860,52.517037?number=3&bearings=0,20'
```

         ],
      }
   ],
   "code" : "Ok"
}
```

### Route service

Finds the fastest route between coordinates in the supplied order.

```endpoint
GET http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:{profile}/route/v1/test/{coordinates}?alternatives={true|false|number}&steps={true|false}&geometries={polyline|polyline6|geojson}&overview={full|simplified|false}&annotations={true|false}

```

In addition to the [general options](#general-options) the following options are supported for this service:

|Option      |Values                                       |Description                                                                    |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|alternatives|`true`, `false` (default), or Number         |Search for alternative routes. Passing a number `alternatives=n` searches for up to `n` alternative routes.\*                            |
|steps       |`true`, `false` (default)                    |Returned route steps for each route leg                                        |
|annotations |`true`, `false` (default), `nodes`, `distance`, `duration`, `datasources`, `weight`, `speed`  |Returns additional metadata for each coordinate along the route geometry.      |
|geometries  |`polyline` (default), `polyline6`, `geojson` |Returned route geometry format (influences overview and per step)              |
|overview    |`simplified` (default), `full`, `false`      |Add overview geometry either full, simplified according to highest zoom level it could be display on, or not at all.|
|continue\_straight |`default` (default), `true`, `false`  |Forces the route to keep going straight at waypoints constraining uturns there even if it would be faster. Default value depends on the profile. |
|waypoints   | `{index};{index};{index}...`                |Treats input coordinates indicated by given indices as waypoints in returned Match object. Default is to treat all input coordinates as waypoints.    |

\* Please note that even if alternative routes are requested, a result cannot be guaranteed.

**Response**

- `code` if the request was successful `Ok` otherwise see the service dependent and general status codes.
- `waypoints`: Array of `Waypoint` objects representing all waypoints in order:
- `routes`: An array of `Route` objects, ordered by descending recommendation rank.

In case of error the following `code`s are supported in addition to the general ones:

| Type              | Description     |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `NoRoute`         | No route found. |

All other properties might be undefined.

#### Example Request

```curl
# Query on Berlin with three coordinates and no overview geometry returned:
curl 'http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:5000/route/v1/test/13.388860,52.517037;13.397634,52.529407;13.428555,52.523219?overview=false'
```

### Table service

Computes the duration of the fastest route between all pairs of supplied coordinates. Returns durations or distances or both between the coordinate pairs. Note that the distances are not the shortest distance between two coordinates, but rather the distances of the fastest routes. Durations are in seconds and distances are in meters.

```endpoint
GET http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:{profile}/table/v1/test/{coordinates}?{sources}=[{elem}...];&{destinations}=[{elem}...]&annotations={duration|distance|duration,distance}
```

**Options**

In addition to the [general options](#general-options) the following options are supported for this service:

|Option      |Values                                            |Description                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|sources     |`{index};{index}[;{index} ...]` or `all` (default)|Use location with given index as source.     |
|destinations|`{index};{index}[;{index} ...]` or `all` (default)|Use location with given index as destination.|
|annotations |`duration` (default), `distance`, or `duration,distance`|Return the requested table or tables in response. |
|fallback_speed|`double > 0`| If no route found between a source/destination pair, calculate the as-the-crow-flies distance, then use this speed to estimate duration.|
|fallback_coordinate|`input` (default), or `snapped`| When using a `fallback_speed`, use the user-supplied coordinate (`input`), or the snapped location (`snapped`) for calculating distances.|
|scale_factor|`double > 0`| Use in conjunction with `annotations=durations`. Scales the table `duration` values by this number.|

Unlike other array encoded options, the length of `sources` and `destinations` can be **smaller or equal**
to number of input locations;

With `skip_waypoints` set to `true`, both `sources` and `destinations` arrays will be skipped.

**Example:**

```
sources=0;5;7&destinations=5;1;4;2;3;6
```

|Element     |Values                       |
|------------|-----------------------------|
|index       |`0 <= integer < #locations`  |

#### Example Request

```

**Response**

- `code` if the request was successful `Ok` otherwise see the service dependent and general status codes.
- `durations` array of arrays that stores the matrix in row-major order. `durations[i][j]` gives the travel time from
  the i-th source to the j-th destination. Values are given in seconds. Can be `null` if no route between `i` and `j` can be found.
- `distances` array of arrays that stores the matrix in row-major order. `distances[i][j]` gives the travel distance from
  the i-th source to the j-th destination. Values are given in meters. Can be `null` if no route between `i` and `j` can be found.
- `sources` array of `Waypoint` objects describing all sources in order
- `destinations` array of `Waypoint` objects describing all destinations in order
- `fallback_speed_cells` (optional) array of arrays containing `i,j` pairs indicating which cells contain estimated values based on `fallback_speed`.  Will be absent if `fallback_speed` is not used.

In case of error the following `code`s are supported in addition to the general ones:

| Type             | Description     |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `NoTable`        | No route found. |
| `NotImplemented`  | This request is not supported |

All other properties might be undefined.

### Match service

Map matching matches/snaps given GPS points to the road network in the most plausible way.
Please note the request might result in multiple sub-traces. Large jumps in the timestamps (> 60s) or improbable transitions lead to trace splits if a complete matching could not be found.
The algorithm might not be able to match all points. Outliers are removed if they can not be matched successfully.

```endpoint
GET http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:{profile}/match/v1/test/{coordinates}?steps={true|false}&geometries={polyline|polyline6|geojson}&overview={simplified|full|false}&annotations={true|false}
```

In addition to the [general options](#general-options) the following options are supported for this service:

|Option      |Values                                          |Description                                                                               |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|steps       |`true`, `false` (default)                       |Returned route steps for each route                                                       |
|geometries  |`polyline` (default), `polyline6`, `geojson`    |Returned route geometry format (influences overview and per step)                         |
|annotations |`true`, `false` (default), `nodes`, `distance`, `duration`, `datasources`, `weight`, `speed`  |Returns additional metadata for each coordinate along the route geometry.                 |
|overview    |`simplified` (default), `full`, `false`         |Add overview geometry either full, simplified according to highest zoom level it could be display on, or not at all.|
|timestamps  |`{timestamp};{timestamp}[;{timestamp} ...]`     |Timestamps for the input locations in seconds since UNIX epoch. Timestamps need to be monotonically increasing. |
|radiuses    |`{radius};{radius}[;{radius} ...]`              |Standard deviation of GPS precision used for map matching. If applicable use GPS accuracy.|
|gaps        |`split` (default), `ignore`                     |Allows the input track splitting based on huge timestamp gaps between points.             |
|tidy        |`true`, `false` (default)                       |Allows the input track modification to obtain better matching quality for noisy tracks.   |
|waypoints   | `{index};{index};{index}...`                   |Treats input coordinates indicated by given indices as waypoints in returned Match object. Default is to treat all input coordinates as waypoints.    |

|Parameter   |Values                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
|timestamp   |`integer` seconds since UNIX epoch |
|radius      |`double >= 0` (default 5m)         |

The radius for each point should be the standard error of the location measured in meters from the true location.
Use `Location.getAccuracy()` on Android or `CLLocation.horizontalAccuracy` on iOS.
This value is used to determine which points should be considered as candidates (larger radius means more candidates) and how likely each candidate is (larger radius means far-away candidates are penalized less).
The area to search is chosen such that the correct candidate should be considered 99.9% of the time.

**Response**

- `code` if the request was successful `Ok` otherwise see the service dependent and general status codes.
- `tracepoints`: Array of `Waypoint` objects representing all points of the trace in order.
  If the tracepoint was omitted by map matching because it is an outlier, the entry will be `null`.
  Each `Waypoint` object has the following additional properties:
  - `matchings_index`: Index to the `Route` object in `matchings` the sub-trace was matched to.
  - `waypoint_index`: Index of the waypoint inside the matched route.
  - `alternatives_count`: Number of probable alternative matchings for this tracepoint. A value of zero indicates that this point was matched unambiguously. Split the trace at these points for incremental map matching.
- `matchings`: An array of `Route` objects that assemble the trace. Each `Route` object has the following additional properties:
  - `confidence`: Confidence of the matching. `float` value between 0 and 1. 1 is very confident that the matching is correct.

In case of error the following `code`s are supported in addition to the general ones:

| Type              | Description         |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| `NoMatch`         | No matchings found. |

All other properties might be undefined.

### Trip service

The trip plugin solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a greedy heuristic (farthest-insertion algorithm) for 10 or more waypoints and uses brute force for less than 10 waypoints.
The returned path does not have to be the fastest one. As TSP is NP-hard it only returns an approximation.
Note that all input coordinates have to be connected for the trip service to work.

```endpoint
GET http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:{profile}/trip/v1/test/{coordinates}?roundtrip={true|false}&source{any|first}&destination{any|last}&steps={true|false}&geometries={polyline|polyline6|geojson}&overview={simplified|full|false}&annotations={true|false}'
```

In addition to the [general options](#general-options) the following options are supported for this service:

|Option      |Values                                          |Description                                                                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|roundtrip   |`true` (default), `false`                       |Returned route is a roundtrip (route returns to first location)            |
|source      |`any` (default), `first`                        |Returned route starts at `any` or `first` coordinate                       |
|destination |`any` (default), `last`                         |Returned route ends at `any` or `last` coordinate                          |
|steps       |`true`, `false` (default)                       |Returned route instructions for each trip                                  |
|annotations |`true`, `false` (default), `nodes`, `distance`, `duration`, `datasources`, `weight`, `speed` |Returns additional metadata for each coordinate along the route geometry.  |
|geometries  |`polyline` (default), `polyline6`, `geojson`    |Returned route geometry format (influences overview and per step)          |
|overview    |`simplified` (default), `full`, `false`         |Add overview geometry either full, simplified according to highest zoom level it could be display on, or not at all.|

**Fixing Start and End Points**

It is possible to explicitly set the start or end coordinate of the trip.
When the source is set to `first`, the first coordinate is used as the start coordinate of the trip in the output. When the destination is set to `last`, the last coordinate will be used as the destination of the trip in the returned output. If you specify `any`, any of the coordinates can be used as the first or last coordinate in the output.

However, if `source=any&destination=any` the returned round-trip will still start at the first input coordinate by default.

Currently, not all combinations of `roundtrip`, `source`, and `destination` are supported.
Right now, the following combinations are possible:

| roundtrip | source | destination | supported |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| true | first | last | **yes** |
| true | first | any | **yes** |
| true | any | last | **yes** |
| true | any | any | **yes** |
| false | first | last | **yes** |
| false | first | any | **yes** |
| false | any | last | **yes** |
| false | any | any | no |

### Tile service

This service generates [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/) that can be viewed with a vector-tile capable slippy-map viewer.  The tiles contain road geometries and metadata that can be used to examine the routing graph.  The tiles are generated directly from the data in-memory, so are in sync with actual routing results, and let you examine which roads are actually routable, and what weights they have applied.

```endpoint
GET http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:{profile}/tile/v1/test/tile({x},{y},{zoom}).mvt
```

The `x`, `y`, and `zoom` values are the same as described at https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames, and are supported by vector tile viewers like [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).

#### Example request

```curl
# This fetches a Z=13 tile for downtown San Francisco:
curl 'http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:5000/tile/v1/test/tile(1310,3166,13).mvt'
```

#### Example response

The response object is either a binary encoded blob with a `Content-Type` of `application/x-protobuf`, or a `404` error.  Note that OSRM is hard-coded to only return tiles from zoom level 12 and higher (to avoid accidentally returning extremely large vector tiles).

Vector tiles contain two layers:

`speeds` layer:

| Property     | Type      | Description                              |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `speed`      | `integer` | the speed on that road segment, in km/h  |
| `is_small`   | `boolean` | whether this segment belongs to a small (< 1000 node) [strongly connected component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component) |
| `datasource` | `string`  | the source for the speed value (normally `lua profile` unless you're using the [traffic update feature](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Traffic), in which case it contains the stem of the filename that supplied the speed value for this segment |
| `duration`   | `float`   | how long this segment takes to traverse, in seconds.  This value is to calculate the total route ETA. |
| `weight  `   | `integer` | how long this segment takes to traverse, in units (may differ from `duration` when artificial biasing is applied in the Lua profiles).  ACTUAL ROUTING USES THIS VALUE. |
| `name`       | `string`  | the name of the road this segment belongs to |
| `rate`       | `float`   | the value of `length/weight` - analogous to `speed`, but using the `weight` value rather than `duration`, rounded to the nearest integer |
| `is_startpoint` | `boolean` | whether this segment can be used as a start/endpoint for routes |

`turns` layer:

| Property     | Type      | Description                              |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `bearing_in` | `integer` | the absolute bearing that approaches the intersection.  -180 to +180, 0 = North, 90 = East |
| `turn_angle` | `integer` | the angle of the turn, relative to the `bearing_in`.  -180 to +180, 0 = straight ahead, 90 = 90-degrees to the right |
| `cost`       | `float`   | the time we think it takes to make that turn, in seconds.  May be negative, depending on how the data model is constructed (some turns get a "bonus"). |
| `weight`     | `float`   | the weight we think it takes to make that turn.  May be negative, depending on how the data model is constructed (some turns get a "bonus"). ACTUAL ROUTING USES THIS VALUE |
| `type`       | `string`  | the type of this turn - values like `turn`, `continue`, etc.  See the `StepManeuver` for a partial list, this field also exposes internal turn types that are never returned with an API response |
| `modifier`   | `string`  | the direction modifier of the turn (`left`, `sharp left`, etc) |

### StepManeuver object

**Properties**

- `location`: A `[longitude, latitude]` pair describing the location of the turn.
- `bearing_before`: The clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately before the maneuver.  Range 0-359.
- `bearing_after`: The clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately after the maneuver.  Range 0-359.
- `type` A string indicating the type of maneuver. **new identifiers might be introduced without API change**
   Types unknown to the client should be handled like the `turn` type, the existence of correct `modifier` values is guaranteed.

| `type`           | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `turn`           | a basic turn into the direction of the `modifier`                |
| `new name`       | no turn is taken/possible, but the road name changes. The road can take a turn itself, following `modifier`.                  |
| `depart`         | indicates the departure of the leg                           |
| `arrive`         | indicates the destination of the leg                         |
| `merge`          | merge onto a street (e.g. getting on the highway from a ramp, the `modifier specifies the direction of the merge`) |
| `ramp`           | **Deprecated**. Replaced by `on_ramp` and `off_ramp`.        |
| `on ramp`        | take a ramp to enter a highway (direction given my `modifier`) |
| `off ramp`       | take a ramp to exit a highway (direction given my `modifier`)  |
| `fork`           | take the left/right side at a fork depending on `modifier`   |
| `end of road`    | road ends in a T intersection turn in direction of `modifier`|
| `use lane`       | **Deprecated** replaced by lanes on all intersection entries |
| `continue`       | Turn in direction of `modifier` to stay on the same road     |
| `roundabout`     | traverse roundabout, if the route leaves the roundabout there will be an additional property `exit` for exit counting. The modifier specifies the direction of entering the roundabout. |
| `rotary`         | a traffic circle. While very similar to a larger version of a roundabout, it does not necessarily follow roundabout rules for right of way. It can offer `rotary_name` and/or `rotary_pronunciation` parameters (located in the RouteStep object) in addition to the `exit` parameter (located on the StepManeuver object).  |
| `roundabout turn`| Describes a turn at a small roundabout that should be treated as a normal turn. The `modifier` indicates the turn direction. Example instruction: `At the roundabout turn left`. |
| `notification`   | not an actual turn but a change in the driving conditions. For example the travel mode or classes. If the road takes a turn itself, the `modifier` describes the direction |
| `exit roundabout`| Describes a maneuver exiting a roundabout (usually preceded by a `roundabout` instruction) |
| `exit rotary`    | Describes the maneuver exiting a rotary (large named roundabout) |

  Please note that even though there are `new name` and `notification` instructions, the `mode` and `name` can change
  between all instructions. They only offer a fallback in case nothing else is to report.

- `modifier` An optional `string` indicating the direction change of the maneuver.

| `modifier`        | Description                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `uturn`           | indicates the reversal of direction          |
| `sharp right`     | a sharp right turn                        |
| `right`           | a normal turn to the right                |
| `slight right`    | a slight turn to the right                |
| `straight`        | no relevant change in direction           |
| `slight left`     | a slight turn to the left                 |
| `left`            | a normal turn to the left                 |
| `sharp left`      | a sharp turn to the left                  |

  The list of turns without a modifier is limited to: `depart/arrive`. If the source/target location is close enough to the `depart/arrive` location, no modifier will be given.

  The meaning depends on the `type` property.

| `type`                 | Description                                                                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `turn`                 | `modifier` indicates the change in direction accomplished through the turn                                                |
| `depart`/`arrive`      | `modifier` indicates the position of departure point and arrival point in relation to the current direction of travel      |

- `exit` An optional `integer` indicating the number of the exit to take. The property exists for the `roundabout` / `rotary` property:
  Number of the roundabout exit to take. If an exit is `undefined` the destination is on the roundabout.

### Lane object

A `Lane` represents a turn lane at the corresponding turn location.

**Properties**

- `indications`: an indication (e.g. marking on the road) specifying the turn lane. A road can have multiple indications (e.g. an arrow pointing straight and left). The indications are given in an array, each containing one of the following types. 

| `value`                | Description                                                                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `none`                 | No dedicated indication is shown.                                                                                         |
| `uturn`                | An indication signaling the possibility to reverse (i.e. fully bend arrow).                                               |
| `sharp right`          | An indication indicating a sharp right turn (i.e. strongly bend arrow).                                                   |
| `right`                | An indication indicating a right turn (i.e. bend arrow).                                                                  |
| `slight right`         | An indication indicating a slight right turn (i.e. slightly bend arrow).                                                  |
| `straight`             | No dedicated indication is shown (i.e. straight arrow).                                                                   |
| `slight left`          | An indication indicating a slight left turn (i.e. slightly bend arrow).                                                   |
| `left`                 | An indication indicating a left turn (i.e. bend arrow).                                                                   |
| `sharp left`           | An indication indicating a sharp left turn (i.e. strongly bend arrow).                                                    |

- `valid`: a boolean flag indicating whether the lane is a valid choice in the current maneuver

#### Example

```json
{
    "indications": ["left", "straight"],
    "valid": false
}
 ```

### Intersection object

An intersection gives a full representation of any cross-way the path passes by. For every step, the very first intersection (`intersections[0]`) corresponds to the
location of the StepManeuver. Further intersections are listed for every cross-way until the next turn instruction.

**Properties**

- `location`: A `[longitude, latitude]` pair describing the location of the turn.
- `bearings`: A list of bearing values (e.g. [0,90,180,270]) that are available at the intersection. The bearings describe all available roads at the intersection.  Values are between 0-359 (0=true north)
- `classes`: An array of strings signifying the classes (as specified in the profile) of the road exiting the intersection.
- `entry`: A list of entry flags, corresponding in a 1:1 relationship to the bearings. A value of `true` indicates that the respective road could be entered on a valid route.
  `false` indicates that the turn onto the respective road would violate a restriction.
- `in`: index into bearings/entry array. Used to calculate the bearing just before the turn. Namely, the clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately before the maneuver/passing the intersection. Bearings are given relative to the intersection. To get the bearing
  in the direction of driving, the bearing has to be rotated by a value of 180. The value is not supplied for `depart` maneuvers.
- `out`: index into the bearings/entry array. Used to extract the bearing just after the turn. Namely, The clockwise angle from true north to the
  direction of travel immediately after the maneuver/passing the intersection. The value is not supplied for `arrive` maneuvers.
- `lanes`: Array of `Lane` objects that denote the available turn lanes at the intersection. If no lane information is available for an intersection, the `lanes` property will not be present.

#### Example

```json
{
    "location":[13.394718,52.543096],
    "in":0,
    "out":2,
    "bearings":[60,150,240,330],
    "entry":["false","true","true","true"],
    "classes": ["toll", "restricted"],
    "lanes":{
        "indications": ["left", "straight"],
        "valid": false
    }
}
```

### Waypoint object

The object is used to describe the waypoint on a route.

**Properties**

- `name` Name of the street the coordinate snapped to
- `location` Array that contains the `[longitude, latitude]` pair of the snapped coordinate
- `distance` The distance, in meters, from the input coordinate to the snapped coordinate
- `hint` Unique internal identifier of the segment (ephemeral, not constant over data updates)
   This can be used on subsequent requests to significantly speed up the query and to connect multiple services.
   E.g. you can use the `hint` value obtained by the `nearest` query as `hint` values for `route` inputs.

#### Example

```json
{
   "hint" : "KSoKADRYroqUBAEAEAAAABkAAAAGAAAAAAAAABhnCQCLtwAA_0vMAKlYIQM8TMwArVghAwEAAQH1a66g",
   "distance" : 4.152629,
   "name" : "Friedrichstraße",
   "location" : [
      13.388799,
      52.517033
   ]
}
```

## Flatbuffers format

The default response format is `json`, but OSRM supports binary [`flatbuffers`](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) format, which
is much faster in serialization/deserialization, comparing to `json`.

The format itself is described in message descriptors, located at `include/engine/api/flatbuffers` directory. Those descriptors could
be compiled to provide protocol parsers in Go/Javascript/Typescript/Java/Dart/C#/Python/Lobster/Lua/Rust/PHP/Kotlin. Precompiled
protocol parser for C++ is supplied with OSRM.

`Flatbuffers` format provides exactly the same data, as `json` format with a slightly different layout, which was optimized to minimize
in-transfer size.

### Root object

Root object is the only object, available from a 'raw' `flatbuffers` buffer. It can be constructed with a following call:

         auto osrm = osrm::engine::api::fbresult::GetFBResult(some_input_buffer);

**Properties**

- `error`: `bool` Marks response as erroneous. An erroneous response should include the `code` fieldset, all the other fields may not be present.
- `code`: `Error` Error description object, only present, when `error` is `true`
- `waypoints`: `[Waypoint]` Array of `Waypoint` objects. Should present for every service call, unless `skip_waypoints` is set to `true`. Table service will put `sources` array here.
- `routes`: `[RouteObject]` Array of `RouteObject` objects. May be empty or absent. Should present for Route/Trip/Match services call.
- `table`: `Table` Table object, may absent. Should be present in case of Table service call.

### Error object

Contains error information.

**Properties**

- `code`: `string` Error code
- `message`: `string` Detailed error message

### Waypoint object

Almost the same as `json` Waypoint object. The following properties differ:

- `location`: `Position` Same as `json` location field, but different format.
- `nodes`: `Uint64Pair` Same as `json` nodes field, but different format.

- `coordinates`: `[Position]` Same as `json` geometry.coordinates field, but different format.
- `legs`: `[Leg]` Array of `Leg` objects.

### Leg object

Almost the same as `json` Leg object. The following properties differ:

- `annotations`: `Annotation` Same as `json` annotation field, but different format.
- `steps`: `[Step]` Same as `step` annotation field, but different format.

### Step object

Almost the same as `json` Step object. The following properties differ:

- `polyline`: `string` Same as `json` geometry.polyline or geometry.polyline6 fields. One field for both formats.
- `coordinates`: `[Position]` Same as `json` geometry.coordinates field, but different format.
- `maneuver`: `StepManeuver` Same as `json` maneuver field, but different format.

| `Roundabout`     | traverse roundabout, if the route leaves the roundabout there will be an additional property `exit` for exit counting. The modifier specifies the direction of entering the roundabout.                                                                                                                                      |
| `Rotary`         | a traffic circle. While very similar to a larger version of a roundabout, it does not necessarily follow roundabout rules for right of way.

| `RoundaboutTurn` | Describes a turn at a small roundabout that should be treated as a normal turn. The `modifier` indicates the turn direction. Example instruction: `At the roundabout turn left`.                                                                                                                                               |
| `Notification`   | not an actual turn but a change in the driving conditions. For example the travel mode or classes. If the road takes a turn itself, the `modifier` describes the direction                                                                                                                                                   |
| `ExitRoundabout` | Describes a maneuver exiting a roundabout (usually preceded by a `roundabout` instruction)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `ExitRotary`     | Describes the maneuver exiting a rotary (large named roundabout)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Almost the same as `json` StepManeuver object. The following properties differ:

- `location`: `Position` Same as `json` location property, but in a different format.
- `type`: `ManeuverType` Type of a maneuver (enum)

| `type`           | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|

Below is all the documentation on how to use the http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8085/ endpoints.
## Search queries

The search API allows you to look up a location from a textual description
or address. This API supports structured and free-form search queries.

### Endpoint

The search API has the following format:

```
http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8085/search?<params>
```

The query term can be given in two different forms: free-form or structured.

### Free-form query

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------| ----- |
| q         | Free-form query string to search for |

In this form, the query can be unstructured.
Free-form queries are processed first left-to-right and then right-to-left if that fails. So you may search for
[pilkington avenue, birmingham](http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8085/search?q=pilkington+avenue,birmingham) as well as for
[birmingham, pilkington avenue](http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8085/search?q=birmingham,+pilkington+avenue).
Commas are optional, but improve performance by reducing the complexity of the search.

The free-form may also contain special phrases to describe the type of
place to be returned or a coordinate to search close to a position.

### Structured query

| Parameter  | Value |
|----------- | ----- |
| amenity    | name and/or type of POI |
| street     | housenumber and streetname |
| city       | city |
| county     | county |
| state      | state |
| country    | country |
| postalcode | postal code |

The structured form of the search query allows to lookup up an address
that is already split into its components. Each parameter represents a field
of the address. All parameters are optional. You should only use the ones
that are relevant for the address you want to geocode.

!!! Attention
    Cannot be combined with the `q=<query>` parameter. Newer versions of
    the API will return an error if you do so. Older versions simply return
    unexpected results.

### Parameters

The following parameters can be used to further restrict the search and
change the output. They are usable for both forms of the search query.

#### Output format

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| format    | one of: `xml`, `json`, `jsonv2`, `geojson`, `geocodejson` | `jsonv2` |


| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| json_callback | function name | _unset_ |

When given, then JSON output will be wrapped in a callback function with
the given name. See [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) for more
information.

Only has an effect for JSON output formats.

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| limit     | number | 10 |

Limit the maximum number of returned results. Cannot be more than 40.
The endpoint may decide to return less results than given, if additional
results do not sufficiently match the query.


#### Output details

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| addressdetails | 0 or 1 | 0 |

When set to 1, include a breakdown of the address into elements.
The exact content of the address breakdown depends on the output format.

!!! tip
    If you are interested in a stable classification of address categories
    (suburb, city, state, etc), have a look at the `geocodejson` format.
    All other formats return classifications according to OSM tagging.
    There is a much larger set of categories and they are not always consistent,
    which makes them very hard to work with.


| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| extratags | 0 or 1 | 0 |

When set to 1, the response include any additional information in the result
that is available in the database, e.g. wikipedia link, opening hours.


| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| namedetails | 0 or 1 | 0 |

When set to 1, include a full list of names for the result. These may include
language variants, older names, references and brand.


#### Language of results

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| accept-language | browser language string | content of "Accept-Language" HTTP header |

Preferred language order for showing search results. This may either be
a simple comma-separated list of language codes or have the same format
as the ["Accept-Language" HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language).

#### Result restriction

There are two ways to influence the results. *Filters* exclude certain
kinds of results completely. *Boost parameters* only change the order of the
results and thus give a preference to some results over others.

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| countrycodes | comma-separated list of country codes | _unset_ |

Filter that limits the search results to one or more countries.
The country code must be the
[ISO 3166-1alpha2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code
of the country, e.g. `gb` for the United Kingdom, `de` for Germany.

Each place is assigned to one country code based
on OSM country boundaries. In rare cases a place may not be in any country
at all, for example, when it is in international waters. These places are
also excluded when the filter is set.

!!! Note
    This parameter should not be confused with the 'country' parameter of
    the structured query. The 'country' parameter contains a search term
    and will be handled with some fuzziness. The `countrycodes` parameter
    is a hard filter and as such should be preferred. Having both parameters
    in the same query will work. If the parameters contradict each other,
    the search will come up empty.

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| layer     | comma-separated list of: `address`, `poi`, `railway`, `natural`, `manmade` | _unset_ (no restriction) |

The layer filter allows to select places by themes.

The `address` layer contains all places that make up an address:
address points with house numbers, streets, inhabited places (suburbs, villages,
cities, states tec.) and administrative boundaries.

The `poi` layer selects all point of interest. This includes classic POIs like
restaurants, shops, hotels but also less obvious features like recycling bins,
guideposts or benches.

The `railway` layer includes railway infrastructure like tracks.
Note that only very few railway
features are imported into the database.

The `natural` layer collects features like rivers, lakes and mountains while
the `manmade` layer functions as a catch-all for features not covered by the
other layers.

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| featureType | one of: `country`, `state`, `city`, `settlement` | _unset_ |

The featureType allows to have a more fine-grained selection for places
from the address layer. Results can be restricted to places that make up
the 'state', 'country' or 'city' part of an address. A featureType of
settlement selects any human inhabited feature from 'state' down to
'neighbourhood'.

When featureType is set, then results are automatically restricted
to the address layer (see above).

!!! tip
    Instead of using the featureType filters `country`, `state` or `city`,
    you can also use a structured query without the finer-grained parameters
    amenity or street.

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| exclude_place_ids | comma-separated list of place ids |

If you do not want certain OSM objects to appear in the search
result, give a comma separated list of the `place_id`s you want to skip.
This can be used to retrieve additional search results. For example, if a
previous query only returned a few results, then including those here would
cause the search to return other, less accurate, matches (if possible).

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| viewbox   | `<x1>,<y1>,<x2>,<y2>` | _unset_ |

Boost parameter which focuses the search on the given area.
Any two corner points of the box are accepted as long as they make a proper
box. `x` is longitude, `y` is latitude.

| Parameter | Value  | Default |
|-----------| -----  | ------- |
| bounded   | 0 or 1 | 0       |

When set to 1, then it turns the 'viewbox' parameter (see above) into
a filter parameter, excluding any results outside the viewbox.

When `bounded=1` is given and the viewbox is small enough, then an amenity-only
search is allowed. Give the special keyword for the amenity in square
brackets, e.g. `[pub]` and a selection of objects of this type is returned.
There is no guarantee that the result returns all objects in the area.


#### Polygon output

| Parameter | Value  | Default |
|-----------| -----  | ------- |
| polygon_geojson | 0 or 1 | 0 |
| polygon_kml     | 0 or 1 | 0 |
| polygon_svg     | 0 or 1 | 0 |
| polygon_text    | 0 or 1 | 0 |

Add the full geometry of the place to the result output. Output formats
in GeoJSON, KML, SVG or WKT are supported. Only one of these
options can be used at a time.

| Parameter | Value  | Default |
|-----------| -----  | ------- |
| polygon_threshold | floating-point number | 0.0 |

When one of the polygon_* outputs is chosen, return a simplified version
of the output geometry. The parameter describes the
tolerance in degrees with which the geometry may differ from the original
geometry. Topology is preserved in the geometry.

## Address lookup

The lookup API allows to query the address and other details of one or
multiple OSM objects like node, way or relation.

### Endpoint

The lookup API has the following format:

```
http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8085/lookup?osm_ids=[N|W|R]<value>,…,…,&<params>
```

`osm_ids` is mandatory and must contain a comma-separated list of OSM ids each
prefixed with its type, one of node(N), way(W) or relation(R). Up to 50 ids
can be queried at the same time.

### Parameters

This section lists additional optional parameters.

#### Output format

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| format    | one of: `xml`, `json`, `jsonv2`, `geojson`, `geocodejson` | `jsonv2` |


| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| json_callback | function name | _unset_ |

When given, then JSON output will be wrapped in a callback function with
the given name. See [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) for more
information.

Only has an effect for JSON output formats.


#### Output details

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| addressdetails | 0 or 1 | 0 |

When set to 1, include a breakdown of the address into elements.
The exact content of the address breakdown depends on the output format.

!!! tip
    If you are interested in a stable classification of address categories
    (suburb, city, state, etc), have a look at the `geocodejson` format.
    All other formats return classifications according to OSM tagging.
    There is a much larger set of categories and they are not always consistent,
    which makes them very hard to work with.


| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| extratags | 0 or 1 | 0 |

When set to 1, the response include any additional information in the result
that is available in the database, e.g. wikipedia link, opening hours.


| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| namedetails | 0 or 1 | 0 |

When set to 1, include a full list of names for the result. These may include
language variants, older names, references and brand.


#### Language of results

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| accept-language | browser language string | content of "Accept-Language" HTTP header |

Preferred language order for showing search results. This may either be
a simple comma-separated list of language codes or have the same format
as the ["Accept-Language" HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language).


#### Polygon output

| Parameter | Value  | Default |
|-----------| -----  | ------- |
| polygon_geojson | 0 or 1 | 0 |
| polygon_kml     | 0 or 1 | 0 |
| polygon_svg     | 0 or 1 | 0 |
| polygon_text    | 0 or 1 | 0 |

Add the full geometry of the place to the result output. Output formats
in GeoJSON, KML, SVG or WKT are supported. Only one of these
options can be used at a time.

| Parameter | Value  | Default |
|-----------| -----  | ------- |
| polygon_threshold | floating-point number | 0.0 |

When one of the polygon_* outputs is chosen, return a simplified version
of the output geometry. The parameter describes the
tolerance in degrees with which the geometry may differ from the original
geometry. Topology is preserved in the geometry.

## Reverse Geocoding

Reverse geocoding generates an address from a coordinate given as
latitude and longitude.

### How it works

The reverse geocoding API does not exactly compute the address for the
coordinate it receives. It works by finding the closest suitable OSM object
and returning its address information. This may occasionally lead to
unexpected results.

First of all, this API only includes OSM objects in
its index that are suitable for searching. Small, unnamed paths for example
are missing from the database and can therefore not be used for reverse
geocoding either.

The other issue to be aware of is that the closest OSM object may not always
have a similar enough address to the coordinate you were requesting. For
example, in dense city areas it may belong to a completely different street.

### Endpoint

The main format of the reverse API is

```
http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8085/reverse?lat=<value>&lon=<value>&<params>
```

where `lat` and `lon` are latitude and longitude of a coordinate in WGS84
projection. The API returns exactly one result or an error when the coordinate
is in an area with no OSM data coverage.

### Parameters

This section lists additional parameters to further influence the output.

#### Output format

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| format    | one of: `xml`, `json`, `jsonv2`, `geojson`, `geocodejson` | `xml` |

See [Place Output Formats](Output.md) for details on each format.


| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| json_callback | function name | _unset_ |

When given, then JSON output will be wrapped in a callback function with
the given name. See [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) for more
information.

Only has an effect for JSON output formats.


#### Output details

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| addressdetails | 0 or 1 | 1 |

When set to 1, include a breakdown of the address into elements.
The exact content of the address breakdown depends on the output format.

!!! tip
    If you are interested in a stable classification of address categories
    (suburb, city, state, etc), have a look at the `geocodejson` format.
    All other formats return classifications according to OSM tagging.
    There is a much larger set of categories and they are not always consistent,
    which makes them very hard to work with.


| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| extratags | 0 or 1 | 0 |

When set to 1, the response include any additional information in the result
that is available in the database, e.g. wikipedia link, opening hours.


| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| namedetails | 0 or 1 | 0 |

When set to 1, include a full list of names for the result. These may include
language variants, older names, references and brand.


#### Language of results

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| accept-language | browser language string | content of "Accept-Language" HTTP header |

Preferred language order for showing search results. This may either be
a simple comma-separated list of language codes or have the same format
as the ["Accept-Language" HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language).

!!! tip
    First-time users tend to be confused that they get different
    results when using in the browser versus in a command-line tool
    like wget or curl. The command-line tools
    usually don't send any Accept-Language header, prompting
    to show results in the local language. Browsers on the contrary always
    send the currently chosen browser language.


#### Result restriction

| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| zoom      | 0-18  | 18      |

Level of detail required for the address. This is a number that
corresponds roughly to the zoom level used in XYZ tile sources in frameworks
like Leaflet.js, Openlayers etc.
In terms of address details the zoom levels are as follows:

 zoom | address detail
 -----|---------------
  3   | country
  5   | state
  8   | county
  10  | city
  12  | town / borough
  13  | village / suburb
  14  | neighbourhood
  15  | any settlement
  16  | major streets
  17  | major and minor streets
  18  | building


| Parameter | Value | Default |
|-----------| ----- | ------- |
| layer     | comma-separated list of: `address`, `poi`, `railway`, `natural`, `manmade` | _unset_ (no restriction) |


The layer filter allows to select places by themes.

The `address` layer contains all places that make up an address:
address points with house numbers, streets, inhabited places (suburbs, villages,
cities, states etc.) and administrative boundaries.

The `poi` layer selects all point of interest. This includes classic points
of interest like restaurants, shops, hotels but also less obvious features
like recycling bins, guideposts or benches.

The `railway` layer includes railway infrastructure like tracks.
Note that only very few railway
features are imported into the database.

The `natural` layer collects features like rivers, lakes and mountains while
the `manmade` layer functions as a catch-all for features not covered by the
other layers.


#### Polygon output

| Parameter | Value  | Default |
|-----------| -----  | ------- |
| polygon_geojson | 0 or 1 | 0 |
| polygon_kml     | 0 or 1 | 0 |
| polygon_svg     | 0 or 1 | 0 |
| polygon_text    | 0 or 1 | 0 |

Add the full geometry of the place to the result output. Output formats
in GeoJSON, KML, SVG or WKT are supported. Only one of these
options can be used at a time.

| Parameter | Value  | Default |
|-----------| -----  | ------- |
| polygon_threshold | floating-point number | 0.0 |

When one of the polygon_* outputs is chosen, return a simplified version
of the output geometry. The parameter describes the
tolerance in degrees with which the geometry may differ from the original
geometry. Topology is preserved in the geometry.

# Place Output

The [/reverse](Reverse.md), [/search](Search.md) and [/lookup](Lookup.md)
API calls produce very similar output which is explained in this section.
There is one section for each format. The format correspond to what was
selected via the `format` parameter.

## JSON

The JSON format returns an array of places (for search and lookup) or
a single place (for reverse) of the following format:

```
  {
    "place_id": 100149,
    "licence": "Data © OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL 1.0. https://osm.org/copyright",
    "osm_type": "node",
    "osm_id": "107775",
    "boundingbox": ["51.3473219", "51.6673219", "-0.2876474", "0.0323526"],
    "lat": "51.5073219",
    "lon": "-0.1276474",
    "display_name": "London, Greater London, England, SW1A 2DU, United Kingdom",
    "class": "place",
    "type": "city",
    "importance": 0.9654895765402,
    "icon": "http://metis.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8085/images/mapicons/poi_place_city.p.20.png",
    "address": {
      "city": "London",
      "state_district": "Greater London",
      "state": "England",
      "ISO3166-2-lvl4": "GB-ENG",
      "postcode": "SW1A 2DU",
      "country": "United Kingdom",
      "country_code": "gb"
    },
    "extratags": {
      "capital": "yes",
      "website": "http://www.london.gov.uk",
      "wikidata": "Q84",
      "wikipedia": "en:London",
      "population": "8416535"
    }
  }
```

The possible fields are:

 * `place_id` - reference to the internal database ID ([see notes](#place_id-is-not-a-persistent-id))
 * `osm_type`, `osm_id` - reference to the OSM object ([see notes](#osm-reference))
 * `boundingbox` - area of corner coordinates ([see notes](#boundingbox))
 * `lat`, `lon` - latitude and longitude of the centroid of the object
 * `display_name` - full comma-separated address
 * `class`, `type` - key and value of the main OSM tag
 * `importance` - computed importance rank
 * `icon` - link to class icon (if available)
 * `address` - dictionary of address details (only with `addressdetails=1`,
   [see notes](#addressdetails))
 * `extratags` - dictionary with additional useful tags like website or maxspeed
   (only with `extratags=1`)
 * `namedetails` - dictionary with full list of available names including ref etc.
 * `geojson`, `svg`, `geotext`, `geokml` - full geometry
   (only with the appropriate `polygon_*` parameter)

## JSONv2

This is the same as the JSON format with two changes:

 * `class` renamed to `category`
 * additional field `place_rank` with the search rank of the object

## GeoJSON

This format follows the [RFC7946](https://geojson.org). Every feature includes
a bounding box (`bbox`).

The properties object has the following fields:

 * `place_id` - reference to the internal database ID ([see notes](#place_id-is-not-a-persistent-id))
 * `osm_type`, `osm_id` - reference to the OSM object ([see notes](#osm-reference))
 * `category`, `type` - key and value of the main OSM tag
 * `display_name` - full comma-separated address
 * `place_rank` - class search rank
 * `importance` - computed importance rank
 * `icon` - link to class icon (if available)
 * `address` - dictionary of address details (only with `addressdetails=1`,
   [see notes](#addressdetails))
 * `extratags` - dictionary with additional useful tags like `website` or `maxspeed`
   (only with `extratags=1`)
 * `namedetails` - dictionary with full list of available names including ref etc.

Use `polygon_geojson` to output the full geometry of the object instead
of the centroid.

## GeocodeJSON

The GeocodeJSON format follows the
[GeocodeJSON spec 0.1.0](https://github.com/geocoders/geocodejson-spec).
The following feature attributes are implemented:

 * `osm_type`, `osm_id` - reference to the OSM object (unofficial extension, [see notes](#osm-reference))
 * `type` - the 'address level' of the object ('house', 'street', `district`, `city`,
            `county`, `state`, `country`, `locality`)
 * `osm_key`- key of the main tag of the OSM object (e.g. boundary, highway, amenity)
 * `osm_value` - value of the main tag of the OSM object (e.g. residential, restaurant)
 * `label` - full comma-separated address
 * `name` - localised name of the place
 * `housenumber`, `street`, `locality`, `district`, `postcode`, `city`,
   `county`, `state`, `country` -
   provided when it can be determined from the address
 * `admin` - list of localised names of administrative boundaries (only with `addressdetails=1`)

Use `polygon_geojson` to output the full geometry of the object instead
of the centroid.

## XML

The XML response returns one or more place objects in slightly different
formats depending on the API call.

### Reverse

```

    <tag key="name:prefix" value="Freistaat"/>
  </extratags>
</reversegeocode>
```

The attributes of the outer `reversegeocode` element return generic information
about the query, including the time when the response was sent (in UTC),
attribution to OSM and the original querystring.

The place information can be found in the `result` element. The attributes of that element contain:

 * `place_id` - reference to the internal database ID ([see notes](#place_id-is-not-a-persistent-id))
 * `osm_type`, `osm_id` - reference to the OSM object ([see notes](#osm-reference))
 * `ref` - content of `ref` tag if it exists
 * `lat`, `lon` - latitude and longitude of the centroid of the object
 * `boundingbox` - comma-separated list of corner coordinates ([see notes](#boundingbox))

The full address of the result can be found in the content of the
`result` element as a comma-separated list.

Additional information requested with `addressdetails=1`, `extratags=1` and
`namedetails=1` can be found in extra elements.

### Search and Lookup

```

    <postcode>SW1A 2DU</postcode>
    <country>United Kingdom</country>
    <country_code>gb</country_code>
  </place>
</searchresults>
```

The attributes of the outer `searchresults` or `lookupresults` element return
generic information about the query:

 * `timestamp` - UTC time when the response was sent
 * `attribution` - OSM licensing information
 * `querystring` - original query
 * `polygon` - true when extra geometry information was requested
 * `exclude_place_ids` - IDs of places that should be ignored in a follow-up request
 * `more_url` - search call that will yield additional results for the query
   just sent

The place information can be found in the `place` elements, of which there may
be more than one. The attributes of that element contain:

 * `place_id` - reference to the internal database ID ([see notes](#place_id-is-not-a-persistent-id))
 * `osm_type`, `osm_id` - reference to the OSM object ([see notes](#osm-reference))
 * `ref` - content of `ref` tag if it exists
 * `lat`, `lon` - latitude and longitude of the centroid of the object
 * `boundingbox` - comma-separated list of corner coordinates ([see notes](#boundingbox))
 * `place_rank` - class [search rank](../customize/Ranking.md#search-rank)
 * `address_rank` - place [address rank](../customize/Ranking.md#address-rank)
 * `display_name` - full comma-separated address
 * `class`, `type` - key and value of the main OSM tag
 * `importance` - computed importance rank
 * `icon` - link to class icon (if available)

When `addressdetails=1` is requested, the localised address parts appear
as subelements with the type of the address part.

Additional information requested with `extratags=1` and `namedetails=1` can
be found in extra elements as sub-element of `extratags` and `namedetails`
respectively.


## Notes on field values

### place_id is not a persistent id

The `place_id` is an internal identifier that is assigned data is imported
into the database. The same OSM object will have a different value
on another server. It may even change its ID on the same server when it is
removed and reimported while updating the database with fresh OSM data.
It is thus not useful to treat it as permanent for later use.

The combination `osm_type`+`osm_id` is slightly better but remember in
OpenStreetMap mappers can delete, split, recreate places (and those
get a new `osm_id`), there is no link between those old and new ids.
Places can also change their meaning without changing their `osm_id`,
e.g. when a restaurant is retagged as supermarket. For a more in-depth
discussion see [Permanent ID](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Permanent_ID).

If you need an ID that is consistent over multiple installations of the endpoint,
then you should use the combination of `osm_type`+`osm_id`+`class`.

### OSM reference

The endpoint may sometimes return special objects that do not correspond directly
to an object in OpenStreetMap. These are:

* **Postcodes**. It returns a postcode point created from all mapped
  postcodes of the same name. The class and type of these object is `place=postcdode`.
  No `osm_type` and `osm_id` are included in the result.
* **Housenumber interpolations**. It returns a single interpolated
  housenumber from the interpolation way. The class and type are `place=house`
  and `osm_type` and `osm_id` correspond to the interpolation way in OSM.
* **TIGER housenumber.** It returns a single interpolated housenumber
  from the TIGER data. The class and type are `place=house`
  and `osm_type` and `osm_id` correspond to the street mentioned in the result.

Please note that the `osm_type` and `osm_id` returned may be changed in the
future. You should not expect to only find `node`, `way` and `relation` for
the type.

### boundingbox

Comma separated list of min latitude, max latitude, min longitude, max longitude.
The whole planet would be `-90,90,-180,180`.

Can be used to pan and center the map on the result, for example with leafletjs
mapping library
`map.fitBounds([[bbox[0],bbox[2]],[bbox[1],bbox[3]]], {padding: [20, 20], maxzoom: 16});`

Bounds crossing the antimeridian have a min latitude -180 and max latitude 180,
essentially covering the entire planet.

### addressdetails

Address details in the xml and json formats return a list of names together
with a designation label. Per default the following labels may appear:

 * continent
 * country, country_code
 * region, state, state_district, county, ISO3166-2-lvl<admin_level>
 * municipality, city, town, village
 * city_district, district, borough, suburb, subdivision
 * hamlet, croft, isolated_dwelling
 * neighbourhood, allotments, quarter
 * city_block, residential, farm, farmyard, industrial, commercial, retail
 * road
 * house_number, house_name
 * emergency, historic, military, natural, landuse, place, railway,
   man_made, aerialway, boundary, amenity, aeroway, club, craft, leisure,
   office, mountain_pass, shop, tourism, bridge, tunnel, waterway
 * postcode

They roughly correspond to the classification of the OpenStreetMap data
according to either the `place` tag or the main key of the object.
# Frequently Asked Questions

## API Results

#### 1. The address of my search results contains far-away places that don't belong there.

The endpoints computes the address from two sources in the OpenStreetMap data:
from administrative boundaries and from place nodes. Boundaries are the more
useful source. They precisely describe an area. So it is very clear for
the endpoints if a point belongs to an area or not. Place nodes are more complicated.
These are only points without any precise extent. So it has to take a
guess and assume that an address belongs to the closest place node it can find.
In an ideal world, the endpoints would not need the place nodes but there are
many places on earth where there are no precise boundaries available for
all parts that make up an address. This is in particular true for the more
local address parts, like villages and suburbs. Therefore it is not possible
to completely dismiss place nodes. And sometimes they sneak in where they
don't belong.

As a OpenStreetMap mapper, you can improve the situation in two ways: if you
see a place node for which already an administrative area exists, then you
should _link_ the two by adding the node with a 'label' role to the boundary
relation. If there is no administrative area, you can add the approximate
extent of the place and tag it place=<something> as well.

#### 2. When doing reverse search, the address details have parts that don't contain the point I was looking up.

There is a common misconception how the reverse API call works.
Reverse does not give you the address of the point you asked for. Reverse
returns the closest object to the point you asked for and then returns the
address of that object. Now, if you are close to a border, then the closest
object may be across that border. When it then returns the address,
it contains the county/state/country across the border.

#### 3. I get different counties/states/countries when I change the zoom parameter in the reverse query. How is that possible?

This is basically the same problem as in the previous answer.
The zoom level influences at which search rank it starts looking
for the closest object. So the closest house number maybe on one side of the
border while the closest street is on the other. As the address details contain
the address of the closest object found, you might sometimes get one result,
sometimes the other for the closest point.

#### 4. Can you return the continent?

The endpoint assigns each map feature one country. Those outside any administrative
boundaries are assigned a special no-country. Continents or other super-national
administrations (e.g. European Union, NATO, Custom unions) are not supported.

#### 5. My result has a wrong postcode. Where does it come from?

Most places in OSM don't have a postcode, so the endpoint tries to interpolate
one. It first look at all the places that make up the address of the place.
If one of them has a postcode defined, this is the one to be used. When
none of the address parts has a postcode either, the endpoint interpolates one
from the surrounding objects. If the postcode is for your result is one, then
most of the time there is an OSM object with the wrong postcode nearby.

Below is a list of editing API you could use for fetching and saving raw geodata from/to the OpenStreetMap database APIs. For the following APIs, you should use the endpoint http://miniserver1875.asuscomm.com:3000/. To find out more about the `http://miniserver1875.asuscomm.com:3000/` APIs you could do `from utils import get_api_documentation_map` and then use get_api_documentation_map(API) to learn more about the API.

IMPORTANT: In general, you must always first try to use APIs to perform the task; however, you should use web browsing when there is no useful API available for the task. IMPORTANT: After you tried out using APIs, you must use web browsing to navigate to some URL containing contents that could verify whether the results you obtained by API calling is correct. IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.
