Note: Before actually using a Gitlab API call, *you should call the `get_api_documentation_gitlab` function in the `utils` module to get detailed API documentation of the API.* For example, if you want to use the API GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/repository/commits, you should first do: 
<execute_ipython>
from utils import get_api_documentation_gitlab
get_api_documentation_gitlab('GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/repository/commits')
</execute_ipython>
This will provide you with detailed descriptions of the input parameters and example output jsons.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To submit a merge request for the `build-time-debug` branch to be merged into the `main` branch and assign yourself as the reviewer, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Create the Merge Request**: Use the GitLab API to create a merge request from the `build-time-debug` branch to the `main` branch.
2. **Assign Reviewer**: Use the GitLab API to assign yourself (Byte Blaze) as the reviewer for the merge request.

Let's start by creating the merge request.

### Step 1: Create the Merge Request

We will use the `POST /api/v4/projects/{id}/merge_requests` API to create the merge request. The project ID for `primer/design` is `180`.
CODE:
import requests

# Define the API endpoint and headers
api_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/180/merge_requests"
headers = {
    "PRIVATE-TOKEN": "glpat-KygcYjwtD2JfA6wU4wBd"
}

# Define the payload for creating the merge request
payload = {
    "source_branch": "build-time-debug",
    "target_branch": "main",
    "title": "Merge build-time-debug into main",
    "assignee_id": 2330  # Assigning to Byte Blaze
}

# Make the API request to create the merge request
response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
response_data = response.json()
response_data
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
{'message': ['Another open merge request already exists for this source branch: !455']}

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Since there is already an open merge request for the `build-time-debug` branch, we need to find that merge request and assign yourself as the reviewer.

### Step 2: Find the Existing Merge Request

We will use the `GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/merge_requests` API to list all merge requests for the project and find the one for the `build-time-debug` branch.
CODE:
# Define the API endpoint and headers
api_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/180/merge_requests"
headers = {
    "PRIVATE-TOKEN": "glpat-KygcYjwtD2JfA6wU4wBd"
}

# Define the parameters to filter merge requests by source branch
params = {
    "source_branch": "build-time-debug",
    "state": "opened"
}

# Make the API request to get the merge requests
response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers, params=params)
response_data = response.json()
response_data
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have identified the existing merge request with ID `142598` and IID `455`. Now, we need to ensure that Byte Blaze is assigned as the reviewer for this merge request.

### Step 3: Assign Byte Blaze as the Reviewer

We will use the `PUT /api/v4/projects/{id}/merge_requests/{merge_request_iid}` API to update the merge request and assign Byte Blaze as the reviewer.
CODE:
# Define the API endpoint and headers
api_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/180/merge_requests/455"
headers = {

}

# Define the payload to assign Byte Blaze as the reviewer
payload = {
    "reviewer_ids": [2330]  # Byte Blaze's user ID
}

# Make the API request to update the merge request
response = requests.put(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
response_data = response.json()
response_data
