### Retrieve All Submissions to a Forum

To retrieve all submissions to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`

#### Sort Submissions

You could sort the submissions by `hot`, `new`, `active`, `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`.

For `hot`, `new`, and `active`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/hot`.

For `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}?t={time}`. For $time, you could choose from `day` (which means the past 24 hours), `week` (which means the past 7 days), `month` (which means the past month), `year` (which means the past yeaer), and `all` (which means all times). For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=day` will get you the submissions in the past 24 hours, sorted by number of comments; `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=all` will get you all submissions until now, sorted by number of comments.

#### Retrieve a Specific Submission and All Comments to It

If you already has the submission_id that you would like to retrieve, then you are good to use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/{submission_id}`. For example, the submission_id for the submission with title 'New area code?' to the forum 'allentown' has the submission_id `123256`, then you could do `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

However, if you don't have the submission_id to the submission you would like to retrieve, but you have a keyword or the title of the submission and the name of the forum, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`, and then search for the keyword of the submission in the html response, and the locate the line with format `href="/f/{forum_name}/{submission_id}/...`. For example, if you would like to retrieve the submission to `allentown` with keyword `area`, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`, and then search for `area`. For instance, the response contains the following lines:

```html
<div class="submission__row">

      <div class="submission__inner">
        <header class="submission__header">
          <div class="submission__title-row break-text"><h1 class="submission__title unheaderize inline"><a href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"
         class="submission__link"
                  rel=""
          target="_self"
        >New area code?</a></h1>


                      </div>

          <p class="submission__info">
            <span class="text-sm fg-muted">
              Submitted by         <a href="/user/Francis-pencovic" class="submission__submitter fg-inherit"><strong>Francis-pencovic</strong></a>    <small class="fg-grey text-sm user-flag">t3_11xxi00</small>
   <time class="submission__timestamp"
        data-controller="relative-time"
        datetime="2023-03-21T22:40:42+00:00"
        title="March 21, 2023 at 10:40:42 PM UTC">on March 21, 2023 at 10:40 PM</time>
```
then, `123256` is the submission_id you want. You could find this submission_id by locating the line `href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"`. Then you could call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

### Retrieve All Comments to a Forum

THOUGHT: The response contains the HTML content of the forums page. I need to locate the "books" forum link within this content. Once I have the link, I can navigate to the "books" forum and retrieve the trending posts.

Let's search for the "books" forum link in the HTML content.

# Parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Find the link to the "books" forum
books_forum_link = soup.find('a', href=True, text='books')['href']
books_forum_link

Saw it’s been a few months since this website was discussed. I actually just discovered it last night. Local bookstores are so important and they have so much character we should all do what we can to support this. 

This website allows you to select a local bookstore in your area and 30% of any book purchase on the website goes to the store. 

I think it is amazing!

I'm a manager at an indie bookstore and I agree, [ Bookshop.org ](https://Bookshop.org) is wonderful! It honestly helped keep a lot of smaller indies alive during the pandemic. 

I'd also encourage folks to checkout their local indie's website. It may promote things like free in-store events, indie-exclusive editions of new books, locally self-published authors, or signed bookplates. Plus a lot of them are unionized! 

Thank you so much for supporting independent bookstores and have a wonderful new year. 💕

I have purchased all my books through bookshop.org since the scummy treatment of their employees by Amazon started surfacing. It usually takes a couple of extra days for a book to arrive, but that has made them more of a 'surprise' in the mail. 

Also, if a book you want _isn't_ available on Bookshop, it's usually because the publisher is in an anti-competitive agreement with Amazon, and you should call/email/tweet/toot the _publisher_ (never the author) to complain.

Yes! 

This is particularly problematic with audiobooks. My partner reads them exclusively and even with the library, has not been able to successfully avoid Audible. A ton of audiobooks are exclusive.

Have you checked out [ Libro.fm ](https://Libro.fm) ? It's like Bookshop.org but for audiobooks! 

It doesn't answer the issue of some content being exclusive to Audible, but it's a nice alternative for traditionally published audiobooks.

My partner uses our library almost exclusively. He has only used Audible once, and it's because the book was an exclusive and he was super excited about it. Other exclusives he's run into, he ultimately doesn't read, which is disheartening. I don't think we've ever come across one he wanted that the library didn't have that wasn't an Audible exclusive.

I was on bookshop’s site the other day & it directed me to libro’s site for the purchase. If you didn’t know, libro isn’t much better to creators than amzn/audible & they also promote the monthly credit system.

Libro has been a wonderful partner for indie bookstores! 

I can only speak to my own experience with them as a bookseller and customer (I buy audiobooks every month from them without touching the credit system), and it's been nothing but positive. 

However, I cannot speak to the author's experience! Do you have a source you could point me to? I always want to learn more.

CORRECTION: per PeterAhlstrom “It’s significantly lower than 45% of retail when you use a credit” end correction 

As a customer of libro my only complaint is getting sucked into the monthly credits & then I learned from Brandon Sanderson’s team libro only gives authors 45%. 

Could you offer instruction how to link the comment here? I’m not sure how to do it. 

Edit: “Unfortunately, Libro.FM pays a very low royalty (based on the retail price) when you use a credit. That makes sense when you set the retail price high, but not when we set it at $15 because that's what people actually pay. So we (I'm Brandon's VP of publishing) had to pass on listing the books on Libro.FM. If they change their royalty for cheap books we'll happily change that.” From [ /u/peterahlstrom ](/user/peterahlstrom)

No. I'm not interested in putting narrators and authors out of business because I don't like Amazon. For many self-published authors, in particular, they're on Audible because they can't get on other platforms.

They get sales numbers and they still get more than they would with you pirating. Don't pretend you're doing authors any favors by stealing their work.

Depending on the author they may be able to put pressure in the publisher, I’d argue against “never the author”. The author may not know. Don’t go yell at the author of course.

Most local bookstores will also order books for you and then they get 100% of the profit. But Bookshop.org is a great alternative if you don't actually visit your local bookstores often. Our closest bookstore just links to their bookshop.org page as their online store!

My local bookstore has said that if it’s a book they don’t carry in-store, they make the same profit from bookshop.com as they do if you order from them directly. They heavily promote bookshop for that reason.

Most indies ship even if they don't have an online store. It means calling or emailing them instead of just clicking around but like if you ask directly then they also might tell you they have a used copy, or that the book releases in paperback soon or other useful things

Reminder: Libby is still OverDrive on the backend. Libby is just the new frontend user app to replace their previous app that was named OverDrive. It's all a part of their marketing to make it "friendly". 

It was: OverDrive the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

It's now: Libby the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

EDIT: I'm not saying it's bad at all! Sorry. I'm pointing it out because a lot of people think Libby is its own service and get confused about how it's a part of OverDrive.

I worked as the store manager of an indie shop for a few years after running their online store by myself. 

Abe hardly benefits the actual book shops. It's crowded with megasellers, just like Amazon is. I would say half of listings on both sites are by HalfPriceBooks or Goodwill. Most sellers who move over 1,000 books a year online will use an automatic listing service like Neatoscan that posts on Amazon and Abe (and like 10 other sites) at the same time. 

If you want to benefit actual book stores, buy from their website, call them and buy over the phone, or go visit them in person. Bookshop gets an honorable mention, because they share 30% of the profits with the book store while hosting the site and storing the books and doing the shipping. It's incredibly generous.

I use this site as much as possible instead of Amazon. The prices are not as low as Amazon (because, Amazon) but it's seriously just as convenient, and I love supporting local stores. I'll do this for gifts as well, when I send books to niblings for birthdays/Christmas. And you can preorder stuff too! I've ordered new stuff from Penguin Random House through Bookshop and it generally comes within a day or two of the release date.

Not sure if you knew this, but Penguin has a Reader Rewards program and will accept purchases from just about anywhere, including Bookshop.org, for credit!

It’s not free, but I’ve always read that free shipping is a myth anyway - they just add it to the price of whatever you’re buying. I’ll pay a few bucks in shipping to benefit local shops.

Its really cool but I dont fancy paying delivery fees for already slightly more expensive books. I go to my local shops regularly but if I need something specific that they dont have - Blackwells. Free delivery on anything and 90% of the time prices are cheaper than anywhere else. And that’s why as much as I’d like, I won’t use bookshop.org 

Sadly, as of February, Blackwells is owned by Waterstones corporation. But they still have their own websites and prices and as far as I’m aware the employees are treated well. So I’d rather support them than something owned by Amazon.

But why not just order from your local bookstore's website? All Bookshop does is the same thing local bookstores do: buy the books from the publisher/distributor and then sell them to you. 

Why not give your local bookstore (or some bookstore of your choosing, if you don't have a "local") all the margin, rather than giving Bookshop a little cut? 

If for some reason I can't understand, it's Amazon or Bookshop, then by all means Bookshop. Amazon is bad. I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer, though I guess some locals just set Bookshop up as their online stores, in which case I guess Bookshop is just acting as a webhost and is charging the bookstore a fee for doing it, which is fine. 

Anyway, mostly just putting it out there that most local bookshops would be happy to ship books to you.

My local bookstore says that if it’s a book they don’t have in-store that youre picking up in-store, they make the same profit if you order from bookshop or from them directly. They promote bookshop a lot for this reason. You can always ask your local book store what works best for them.

> I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer 

In short, Bookshop is a _tool_ that good local shops can use to boost their chances of making a sale. 

Bookshop is a great resource for indie stores that focus on promoting local authors and therefore have less in-store space for James Pattersons or Colleen Hoovers. If a fan of those books passes through town, however, the bookstore can still make the sale and gain a customer through bookshop. 

It's great for niche bookstores. I visited a small bookstore in Utah once that focused on mining history, Terry Tempest Williams desert ecology stuff, and touristy coffee table books of Utah scenery. If Bookshop had been a thing then, I could have asked for a copy of A Man Called ove, and they could have said "Sorry, we don't carry that one, since it's not Utah related, _but_ you can order a copy here," and hand me a card for bookshop. 

It's also a lifesaver for used bookstores. They tend to have little control over the books they have. Of course, they decide what to keep and what to put on the shelves, but they can't just magically make Brandon Sanderson books show up. At best, they can have some kind of request system that will flag books and send a notice to a customer. Being able to still sell a book without setting up the entire enterprise of a new bookstore is a saving grace.

As a bookseller, I make about the same profit margin, don’t have to place a special order or worry about shipping/damages from my publisher, and also bookshop provides a profit pool payout twice a year in addition to those funds.

I tried buying an ebook on Bookshop.org and the experience was awful. They required downloading a third-party app which was a hassle in itself. And the reading experience was horrible. It took 3-4 taps to open a book and there was no highlighting or note taking ability. I couldn’t find an option to download an epub to manually load onto my Kindle. Then I discovered their purchase agreement doesn’t allow returns on ebooks, even though this is not disclosed during checkout. Fortunately, they did give me a refund. 

Unfortunately, this is why I stick to Kindle. 

I’d love to find another option, but I also have similar trouble finding what I’m looking for on Libby. And when they do have it, I usually have to wait weeks to check it out.

Thank you for this!

Bookshop.org is fantastic however check who you're supporting by shopping there. The first few times I ordered my money was going to Reedpop, which isn't a giant Amazon conglomerate but not what I would call a small local business. Iirc you can specify through your order who you're supporting.

I almost never buy books, because I use minimalism to help manage my ADHD. (Thank you from my bottom to the libraries!) 

But I just read Emily Nagoski's Come As You Are. I was about to suggest it to my 18-year-old, when I realized that this is the kind of book that's more like a reference text that you might want to read slowly and revisit over the years. 

So I decided to buy her a copy. And I found my local bookseller on bookshop.org! I gave her the book yesterday, and it was predictably awkward, but I told her I wished I'd had that book when I was her age. I hope she finds it helpful.

I'd love to buy more from Bookshop.org but they seem to have a pretty limited stock of books. I look there first most times but never seem to find the exact edition I'm looking for. 95% of the time I end up having to use bookfinder.com.

A lot of small to medium sized book stores have websites now. Just Google bookstore and find a local shop that has a website.

If you have a website that offers affiliate links to vendors (like a blog), then Bookshop offers better terms on commissions than Amazon and you can feel good about where you’re sending folks. This is actually one of the major reasons it was created. 

And if you don’t have a store you’d like to support, you can shop without picking, and the store commission goes into a pool shared by all the independent bookstores who are registered with the site.

Isn't using a website like this avoiding that "character" the local bookstore has? 

If you're not going in, then why's it matter what that in-store experience is to you at that point? 

And further, why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? Why shouldn't a business halfway across the country deserve to survive just as much? I've never really understood this mentality that a business deserves to survive because it hasn't found much success and grown yet, but if it did grow then it'd no longer be worth spending money at

>why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? 

I think it's because indie bookstores usually offer something additional to their communities! 

For example, the indie I work for has the only free public restroom in the shopping area (we believe it's a human right), hosts free in-store events with authors, promotes locally self-published authors, drives authors to schools for in-classroom experiences for kids, hosts a holiday book drive to replenish our local school libraries, and sponsors events across the community! 

Yes, we sell books to the people in our community, but we also try to lift up our community. I hope that makes sense.

I like supporting my community because my community supports me. It’s not a matter of deserving it or not. I want to be able to walk to a bookstore owned by someone local, and purchase a book. I want my neighbors to be able to do the same. I want to be able to go to local book events and see local authors talk.

As a bookseller, my shop supports my community and a portion of profits go back into making our city a better place. I don’t “deserve money” from anyone but when people make the choice to support our shop it stays local, funds free programs, book giveaways and more, and helps our local economy. We work with local authors, nonprofits, and vendors as well giving them a platform.

Friendly reminder that Amazon has more small and local business on it, giving you a wider selection of independent booksellers to support at a lower cost to you and a higher profit to them as Amazon takes far less than 30% of sales.

Amazon has more sellers because it is the only* platform. 

Most of the book sellers are Half Price Books or Goodwill. 

As of 2021, Amazon charged a 15% fee AND a $1.85 fee for every book sale, left you to cover shipping, and you paid for your own warehouse. So on a $10.00 book, fees are already at 33.5% BEFORE shipping and handling.   
Oh wait, there's the cost of goods as well. It's not like you're getting books for free (unless you're Goodwill). Publishers usually charge stores about 40-60% of the cover price. 

So my ten dollar book gets me 6.65 before shipping and handling, 2.65 after shipping, 2.55 after storage if I have a great deal on a warehouse, and NEGATIVE $1.45 after I pay the publisher. 

A $30.00 book will only net me $7.52 after that. From that money, I need to pay employees and invest in improvements to my store.   
Bookshop just hands my store $9.00 on that same sale, and they store and they ship. 

*I know Amazon isn't the only platform, but they've dominated to market to the point of monopoly.

Saw it’s been a few months since this website was discussed. I actually just discovered it last night. Local bookstores are so important and they have so much character we should all do what we can to support this. 

This website allows you to select a local bookstore in your area and 30% of any book purchase on the website goes to the store. 

I think it is amazing!

I'm a manager at an indie bookstore and I agree, [ Bookshop.org ](https://Bookshop.org) is wonderful! It honestly helped keep a lot of smaller indies alive during the pandemic. 

I'd also encourage folks to checkout their local indie's website. It may promote things like free in-store events, indie-exclusive editions of new books, locally self-published authors, or signed bookplates. Plus a lot of them are unionized! 

Thank you so much for supporting independent bookstores and have a wonderful new year. 💕

I have purchased all my books through bookshop.org since the scummy treatment of their employees by Amazon started surfacing. It usually takes a couple of extra days for a book to arrive, but that has made them more of a 'surprise' in the mail. 

Also, if a book you want _isn't_ available on Bookshop, it's usually because the publisher is in an anti-competitive agreement with Amazon, and you should call/email/tweet/toot the _publisher_ (never the author) to complain.

Yes! 

This is particularly problematic with audiobooks. My partner reads them exclusively and even with the library, has not been able to successfully avoid Audible. A ton of audiobooks are exclusive.

Have you checked out [ Libro.fm ](https://Libro.fm) ? It's like Bookshop.org but for audiobooks! 

It doesn't answer the issue of some content being exclusive to Audible, but it's a nice alternative for traditionally published audiobooks.

My partner uses our library almost exclusively. He has only used Audible once, and it's because the book was an exclusive and he was super excited about it. Other exclusives he's run into, he ultimately doesn't read, which is disheartening. I don't think we've ever come across one he wanted that the library didn't have that wasn't an Audible exclusive.

Libro has been a wonderful partner for indie bookstores! 

I can only speak to my own experience with them as a bookseller and customer (I buy audiobooks every month from them without touching the credit system), and it's been nothing but positive. 

However, I cannot speak to the author's experience! Do you have a source you could point me to? I always want to learn more.

CORRECTION: per PeterAhlstrom “It’s significantly lower than 45% of retail when you use a credit” end correction 

As a customer of libro my only complaint is getting sucked into the monthly credits & then I learned from Brandon Sanderson’s team libro only gives authors 45%. 

Could you offer instruction how to link the comment here? I’m not sure how to do it. 

Edit: “Unfortunately, Libro.FM pays a very low royalty (based on the retail price) when you use a credit. That makes sense when you set the retail price high, but not when we set it at $15 because that's what people actually pay. So we (I'm Brandon's VP of publishing) had to pass on listing the books on Libro.FM. If they change their royalty for cheap books we'll happily change that.” From [ /u/peterahlstrom ](/user/peterahlstrom)

No. I'm not interested in putting narrators and authors out of business because I don't like Amazon. For many self-published authors, in particular, they're on Audible because they can't get on other platforms.

Depending on the author they may be able to put pressure in the publisher, I’d argue against “never the author”. The author may not know. Don’t go yell at the author of course.

As long as you aren’t rude reaching out directly to the author is never bad. Sometimes you can purchase directly from them and they get a bigger cut.

Most local bookstores will also order books for you and then they get 100% of the profit. But Bookshop.org is a great alternative if you don't actually visit your local bookstores often. Our closest bookstore just links to their bookshop.org page as their online store!

Indie bookseller here— some indie bookstores have online stores as well that you can order from. I do the online orders at the bookstore I work at and it’s always a thrill to get orders from people across the country who consider us their “local” indie!

My local bookstore has said that if it’s a book they don’t carry in-store, they make the same profit from bookshop.com as they do if you order from them directly. They heavily promote bookshop for that reason.

Most indies ship even if they don't have an online store. It means calling or emailing them instead of just clicking around but like if you ask directly then they also might tell you they have a used copy, or that the book releases in paperback soon or other useful things

Reminder: Libby is still OverDrive on the backend. Libby is just the new frontend user app to replace their previous app that was named OverDrive. It's all a part of their marketing to make it "friendly". 

It was: OverDrive the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

It's now: Libby the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

EDIT: I'm not saying it's bad at all! Sorry. I'm pointing it out because a lot of people think Libby is its own service and get confused about how it's a part of OverDrive.

I worked as the store manager of an indie shop for a few years after running their online store by myself. 

Abe hardly benefits the actual book shops. It's crowded with megasellers, just like Amazon is. I would say half of listings on both sites are by HalfPriceBooks or Goodwill. Most sellers who move over 1,000 books a year online will use an automatic listing service like Neatoscan that posts on Amazon and Abe (and like 10 other sites) at the same time. 

If you want to benefit actual book stores, buy from their website, call them and buy over the phone, or go visit them in person. Bookshop gets an honorable mention, because they share 30% of the profits with the book store while hosting the site and storing the books and doing the shipping. It's incredibly generous.

I use this site as much as possible instead of Amazon. The prices are not as low as Amazon (because, Amazon) but it's seriously just as convenient, and I love supporting local stores. I'll do this for gifts as well, when I send books to niblings for birthdays/Christmas. And you can preorder stuff too! I've ordered new stuff from Penguin Random House through Bookshop and it generally comes within a day or two of the release date.

It’s not free, but I’ve always read that free shipping is a myth anyway - they just add it to the price of whatever you’re buying. I’ll pay a few bucks in shipping to benefit local shops.

Its really cool but I dont fancy paying delivery fees for already slightly more expensive books. I go to my local shops regularly but if I need something specific that they dont have - Blackwells. Free delivery on anything and 90% of the time prices are cheaper than anywhere else. And that’s why as much as I’d like, I won’t use bookshop.org 

Sadly, as of February, Blackwells is owned by Waterstones corporation. But they still have their own websites and prices and as far as I’m aware the employees are treated well. So I’d rather support them than something owned by Amazon.

But why not just order from your local bookstore's website? All Bookshop does is the same thing local bookstores do: buy the books from the publisher/distributor and then sell them to you. 

Why not give your local bookstore (or some bookstore of your choosing, if you don't have a "local") all the margin, rather than giving Bookshop a little cut? 

If for some reason I can't understand, it's Amazon or Bookshop, then by all means Bookshop. Amazon is bad. I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer, though I guess some locals just set Bookshop up as their online stores, in which case I guess Bookshop is just acting as a webhost and is charging the bookstore a fee for doing it, which is fine. 

Anyway, mostly just putting it out there that most local bookshops would be happy to ship books to you.

My local bookstore says that if it’s a book they don’t have in-store that youre picking up in-store, they make the same profit if you order from bookshop or from them directly. They promote bookshop a lot for this reason. You can always ask your local book store what works best for them.

> I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer 

In short, Bookshop is a _tool_ that good local shops can use to boost their chances of making a sale. 

Bookshop is a great resource for indie stores that focus on promoting local authors and therefore have less in-store space for James Pattersons or Colleen Hoovers. If a fan of those books passes through town, however, the bookstore can still make the sale and gain a customer through bookshop. 

It's great for niche bookstores. I visited a small bookstore in Utah once that focused on mining history, Terry Tempest Williams desert ecology stuff, and touristy coffee table books of Utah scenery. If Bookshop had been a thing then, I could have asked for a copy of A Man Called ove, and they could have said "Sorry, we don't carry that one, since it's not Utah related, _but_ you can order a copy here," and hand me a card for bookshop. 

It's also a lifesaver for used bookstores. They tend to have little control over the books they have. Of course, they decide what to keep and what to put on the shelves, but they can't just magically make Brandon Sanderson books show up. At best, they can have some kind of request system that will flag books and send a notice to a customer. Being able to still sell a book without setting up the entire enterprise of a new bookstore is a saving grace.

As a bookseller, I make about the same profit margin, don’t have to place a special order or worry about shipping/damages from my publisher, and also bookshop provides a profit pool payout twice a year in addition to those funds.

I tried buying an ebook on Bookshop.org and the experience was awful. They required downloading a third-party app which was a hassle in itself. And the reading experience was horrible. It took 3-4 taps to open a book and there was no highlighting or note taking ability. I couldn’t find an option to download an epub to manually load onto my Kindle. Then I discovered their purchase agreement doesn’t allow returns on ebooks, even though this is not disclosed during checkout. Fortunately, they did give me a refund. 

Unfortunately, this is why I stick to Kindle. 

I’d love to find another option, but I also have similar trouble finding what I’m looking for on Libby. And when they do have it, I usually have to wait weeks to check it out.

Thank you for this!

Bookshop.org is fantastic however check who you're supporting by shopping there. The first few times I ordered my money was going to Reedpop, which isn't a giant Amazon conglomerate but not what I would call a small local business. Iirc you can specify through your order who you're supporting.

I almost never buy books, because I use minimalism to help manage my ADHD. (Thank you from my bottom to the libraries!) 

But I just read Emily Nagoski's Come As You Are. I was about to suggest it to my 18-year-old, when I realized that this is the kind of book that's more like a reference text that you might want to read slowly and revisit over the years. 

So I decided to buy her a copy. And I found my local bookseller on bookshop.org! I gave her the book yesterday, and it was predictably awkward, but I told her I wished I'd had that book when I was her age. I hope she finds it helpful.

If you have a website that offers affiliate links to vendors (like a blog), then Bookshop offers better terms on commissions than Amazon and you can feel good about where you’re sending folks. This is actually one of the major reasons it was created. 

And if you don’t have a store you’d like to support, you can shop without picking, and the store commission goes into a pool shared by all the independent bookstores who are registered with the site.

Isn't using a website like this avoiding that "character" the local bookstore has? 

If you're not going in, then why's it matter what that in-store experience is to you at that point? 

And further, why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? Why shouldn't a business halfway across the country deserve to survive just as much? I've never really understood this mentality that a business deserves to survive because it hasn't found much success and grown yet, but if it did grow then it'd no longer be worth spending money at

>why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? 

I think it's because indie bookstores usually offer something additional to their communities! 

For example, the indie I work for has the only free public restroom in the shopping area (we believe it's a human right), hosts free in-store events with authors, promotes locally self-published authors, drives authors to schools for in-classroom experiences for kids, hosts a holiday book drive to replenish our local school libraries, and sponsors events across the community! 

Yes, we sell books to the people in our community, but we also try to lift up our community. I hope that makes sense.

I like supporting my community because my community supports me. It’s not a matter of deserving it or not. I want to be able to walk to a bookstore owned by someone local, and purchase a book. I want my neighbors to be able to do the same. I want to be able to go to local book events and see local authors talk.

As a bookseller, my shop supports my community and a portion of profits go back into making our city a better place. I don’t “deserve money” from anyone but when people make the choice to support our shop it stays local, funds free programs, book giveaways and more, and helps our local economy. We work with local authors, nonprofits, and vendors as well giving them a platform.

Friendly reminder that Amazon has more small and local business on it, giving you a wider selection of independent booksellers to support at a lower cost to you and a higher profit to them as Amazon takes far less than 30% of sales.

Amazon has more sellers because it is the only* platform. 

Most of the book sellers are Half Price Books or Goodwill. 

As of 2021, Amazon charged a 15% fee AND a $1.85 fee for every book sale, left you to cover shipping, and you paid for your own warehouse. So on a $10.00 book, fees are already at 33.5% BEFORE shipping and handling.   
Oh wait, there's the cost of goods as well. It's not like you're getting books for free (unless you're Goodwill). Publishers usually charge stores about 40-60% of the cover price. 

So my ten dollar book gets me 6.65 before shipping and handling, 2.65 after shipping, 2.55 after storage if I have a great deal on a warehouse, and NEGATIVE $1.45 after I pay the publisher. 

A $30.00 book will only net me $7.52 after that. From that money, I need to pay employees and invest in improvements to my store.   
Bookshop just hands my store $9.00 on that same sale, and they store and they ship. 

*I know Amazon isn't the only platform, but they've dominated to market to the point of monopoly.

Saw it’s been a few months since this website was discussed. I actually just discovered it last night. Local bookstores are so important and they have so much character we should all do what we can to support this. 

This website allows you to select a local bookstore in your area and 30% of any book purchase on the website goes to the store. 

I think it is amazing!

I'm a manager at an indie bookstore and I agree, [ Bookshop.org ](https://Bookshop.org) is wonderful! It honestly helped keep a lot of smaller indies alive during the pandemic. 

I'd also encourage folks to checkout their local indie's website. It may promote things like free in-store events, indie-exclusive editions of new books, locally self-published authors, or signed bookplates. Plus a lot of them are unionized! 

Thank you so much for supporting independent bookstores and have a wonderful new year. 💕

I have purchased all my books through bookshop.org since the scummy treatment of their employees by Amazon started surfacing. It usually takes a couple of extra days for a book to arrive, but that has made them more of a 'surprise' in the mail. 

Also, if a book you want _isn't_ available on Bookshop, it's usually because the publisher is in an anti-competitive agreement with Amazon, and you should call/email/tweet/toot the _publisher_ (never the author) to complain.

This is particularly problematic with audiobooks. My partner reads them exclusively and even with the library, has not been able to successfully avoid Audible. A ton of audiobooks are exclusive.

Have you checked out [ Libro.fm ](https://Libro.fm) ? It's like Bookshop.org but for audiobooks! 

It doesn't answer the issue of some content being exclusive to Audible, but it's a nice alternative for traditionally published audiobooks.

My partner uses our library almost exclusively. He has only used Audible once, and it's because the book was an exclusive and he was super excited about it. Other exclusives he's run into, he ultimately doesn't read, which is disheartening. I don't think we've ever come across one he wanted that the library didn't have that wasn't an Audible exclusive.

Libro has been a wonderful partner for indie bookstores! 

I can only speak to my own experience with them as a bookseller and customer (I buy audiobooks every month from them without touching the credit system), and it's been nothing but positive. 

However, I cannot speak to the author's experience! Do you have a source you could point me to? I always want to learn more.

CORRECTION: per PeterAhlstrom “It’s significantly lower than 45% of retail when you use a credit” end correction 

As a customer of libro my only complaint is getting sucked into the monthly credits & then I learned from Brandon Sanderson’s team libro only gives authors 45%. 

Could you offer instruction how to link the comment here? I’m not sure how to do it. 

Edit: “Unfortunately, Libro.FM pays a very low royalty (based on the retail price) when you use a credit. That makes sense when you set the retail price high, but not when we set it at $15 because that's what people actually pay. So we (I'm Brandon's VP of publishing) had to pass on listing the books on Libro.FM. If they change their royalty for cheap books we'll happily change that.” From [ /u/peterahlstrom ](/user/peterahlstrom)

No. I'm not interested in putting narrators and authors out of business because I don't like Amazon. For many self-published authors, in particular, they're on Audible because they can't get on other platforms.

Depending on the author they may be able to put pressure in the publisher, I’d argue against “never the author”. The author may not know. Don’t go yell at the author of course.

As long as you aren’t rude reaching out directly to the author is never bad. Sometimes you can purchase directly from them and they get a bigger cut.

Most local bookstores will also order books for you and then they get 100% of the profit. But Bookshop.org is a great alternative if you don't actually visit your local bookstores often. Our closest bookstore just links to their bookshop.org page as their online store!

Indie bookseller here— some indie bookstores have online stores as well that you can order from. I do the online orders at the bookstore I work at and it’s always a thrill to get orders from people across the country who consider us their “local” indie!

My local bookstore has said that if it’s a book they don’t carry in-store, they make the same profit from bookshop.com as they do if you order from them directly. They heavily promote bookshop for that reason.

Most indies ship even if they don't have an online store. It means calling or emailing them instead of just clicking around but like if you ask directly then they also might tell you they have a used copy, or that the book releases in paperback soon or other useful things

Reminder: Libby is still OverDrive on the backend. Libby is just the new frontend user app to replace their previous app that was named OverDrive. It's all a part of their marketing to make it "friendly". 

It was: OverDrive the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

It's now: Libby the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

EDIT: I'm not saying it's bad at all! Sorry. I'm pointing it out because a lot of people think Libby is its own service and get confused about how it's a part of OverDrive.

I worked as the store manager of an indie shop for a few years after running their online store by myself. 

Abe hardly benefits the actual book shops. It's crowded with megasellers, just like Amazon is. I would say half of listings on both sites are by HalfPriceBooks or Goodwill. Most sellers who move over 1,000 books a year online will use an automatic listing service like Neatoscan that posts on Amazon and Abe (and like 10 other sites) at the same time. 

If you want to benefit actual book stores, buy from their website, call them and buy over the phone, or go visit them in person. Bookshop gets an honorable mention, because they share 30% of the profits with the book store while hosting the site and storing the books and doing the shipping. It's incredibly generous.

I use this site as much as possible instead of Amazon. The prices are not as low as Amazon (because, Amazon) but it's seriously just as convenient, and I love supporting local stores. I'll do this for gifts as well, when I send books to niblings for birthdays/Christmas. And you can preorder stuff too! I've ordered new stuff from Penguin Random House through Bookshop and it generally comes within a day or two of the release date.

It’s not free, but I’ve always read that free shipping is a myth anyway - they just add it to the price of whatever you’re buying. I’ll pay a few bucks in shipping to benefit local shops.

Its really cool but I dont fancy paying delivery fees for already slightly more expensive books. I go to my local shops regularly but if I need something specific that they dont have - Blackwells. Free delivery on anything and 90% of the time prices are cheaper than anywhere else. And that’s why as much as I’d like, I won’t use bookshop.org 

Sadly, as of February, Blackwells is owned by Waterstones corporation. But they still have their own websites and prices and as far as I’m aware the employees are treated well. So I’d rather support them than something owned by Amazon.

But why not just order from your local bookstore's website? All Bookshop does is the same thing local bookstores do: buy the books from the publisher/distributor and then sell them to you. 

Why not give your local bookstore (or some bookstore of your choosing, if you don't have a "local") all the margin, rather than giving Bookshop a little cut? 

If for some reason I can't understand, it's Amazon or Bookshop, then by all means Bookshop. Amazon is bad. I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer, though I guess some locals just set Bookshop up as their online stores, in which case I guess Bookshop is just acting as a webhost and is charging the bookstore a fee for doing it, which is fine. 

Anyway, mostly just putting it out there that most local bookshops would be happy to ship books to you.

My local bookstore says that if it’s a book they don’t have in-store that youre picking up in-store, they make the same profit if you order from bookshop or from them directly. They promote bookshop a lot for this reason. You can always ask your local book store what works best for them.

> I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer 

In short, Bookshop is a _tool_ that good local shops can use to boost their chances of making a sale. 

Bookshop is a great resource for indie stores that focus on promoting local authors and therefore have less in-store space for James Pattersons or Colleen Hoovers. If a fan of those books passes through town, however, the bookstore can still make the sale and gain a customer through bookshop. 

It's great for niche bookstores. I visited a small bookstore in Utah once that focused on mining history, Terry Tempest Williams desert ecology stuff, and touristy coffee table books of Utah scenery. If Bookshop had been a thing then, I could have asked for a copy of A Man Called ove, and they could have said "Sorry, we don't carry that one, since it's not Utah related, _but_ you can order a copy here," and hand me a card for bookshop. 

It's also a lifesaver for used bookstores. They tend to have little control over the books they have. Of course, they decide what to keep and what to put on the shelves, but they can't just magically make Brandon Sanderson books show up. At best, they can have some kind of request system that will flag books and send a notice to a customer. Being able to still sell a book without setting up the entire enterprise of a new bookstore is a saving grace.

As a bookseller, I make about the same profit margin, don’t have to place a special order or worry about shipping/damages from my publisher, and also bookshop provides a profit pool payout twice a year in addition to those funds.

I tried buying an ebook on Bookshop.org and the experience was awful. They required downloading a third-party app which was a hassle in itself. And the reading experience was horrible. It took 3-4 taps to open a book and there was no highlighting or note taking ability. I couldn’t find an option to download an epub to manually load onto my Kindle. Then I discovered their purchase agreement doesn’t allow returns on ebooks, even though this is not disclosed during checkout. Fortunately, they did give me a refund. 

Unfortunately, this is why I stick to Kindle. 

I’d love to find another option, but I also have similar trouble finding what I’m looking for on Libby. And when they do have it, I usually have to wait weeks to check it out.

Bookshop.org is fantastic however check who you're supporting by shopping there. The first few times I ordered my money was going to Reedpop, which isn't a giant Amazon conglomerate but not what I would call a small local business. Iirc you can specify through your order who you're supporting.

I almost never buy books, because I use minimalism to help manage my ADHD. (Thank you from my bottom to the libraries!) 

But I just read Emily Nagoski's Come As You Are. I was about to suggest it to my 18-year-old, when I realized that this is the kind of book that's more like a reference text that you might want to read slowly and revisit over the years. 

So I decided to buy her a copy. And I found my local bookseller on bookshop.org! I gave her the book yesterday, and it was predictably awkward, but I told her I wished I'd had that book when I was her age. I hope she finds it helpful.

If you have a website that offers affiliate links to vendors (like a blog), then Bookshop offers better terms on commissions than Amazon and you can feel good about where you’re sending folks. This is actually one of the major reasons it was created. 

And if you don’t have a store you’d like to support, you can shop without picking, and the store commission goes into a pool shared by all the independent bookstores who are registered with the site.

Isn't using a website like this avoiding that "character" the local bookstore has? 

If you're not going in, then why's it matter what that in-store experience is to you at that point? 

And further, why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? Why shouldn't a business halfway across the country deserve to survive just as much? I've never really understood this mentality that a business deserves to survive because it hasn't found much success and grown yet, but if it did grow then it'd no longer be worth spending money at

>why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? 

I think it's because indie bookstores usually offer something additional to their communities! 

For example, the indie I work for has the only free public restroom in the shopping area (we believe it's a human right), hosts free in-store events with authors, promotes locally self-published authors, drives authors to schools for in-classroom experiences for kids, hosts a holiday book drive to replenish our local school libraries, and sponsors events across the community! 

Yes, we sell books to the people in our community, but we also try to lift up our community. I hope that makes sense.

I like supporting my community because my community supports me. It’s not a matter of deserving it or not. I want to be able to walk to a bookstore owned by someone local, and purchase a book. I want my neighbors to be able to do the same. I want to be able to go to local book events and see local authors talk.

As a bookseller, my shop supports my community and a portion of profits go back into making our city a better place. I don’t “deserve money” from anyone but when people make the choice to support our shop it stays local, funds free programs, book giveaways and more, and helps our local economy. We work with local authors, nonprofits, and vendors as well giving them a platform.

Friendly reminder that Amazon has more small and local business on it, giving you a wider selection of independent booksellers to support at a lower cost to you and a higher profit to them as Amazon takes far less than 30% of sales.

Amazon has more sellers because it is the only* platform. 

Most of the book sellers are Half Price Books or Goodwill. 

As of 2021, Amazon charged a 15% fee AND a $1.85 fee for every book sale, left you to cover shipping, and you paid for your own warehouse. So on a $10.00 book, fees are already at 33.5% BEFORE shipping and handling.   
Oh wait, there's the cost of goods as well. It's not like you're getting books for free (unless you're Goodwill). Publishers usually charge stores about 40-60% of the cover price. 

So my ten dollar book gets me 6.65 before shipping and handling, 2.65 after shipping, 2.55 after storage if I have a great deal on a warehouse, and NEGATIVE $1.45 after I pay the publisher. 

A $30.00 book will only net me $7.52 after that. From that money, I need to pay employees and invest in improvements to my store.   
Bookshop just hands my store $9.00 on that same sale, and they store and they ship. 

*I know Amazon isn't the only platform, but they've dominated to market to the point of monopoly.

Saw it’s been a few months since this website was discussed. I actually just discovered it last night. Local bookstores are so important and they have so much character we should all do what we can to support this. 

This website allows you to select a local bookstore in your area and 30% of any book purchase on the website goes to the store. 

I think it is amazing!

I'm a manager at an indie bookstore and I agree, [ Bookshop.org ](https://Bookshop.org) is wonderful! It honestly helped keep a lot of smaller indies alive during the pandemic. 

I'd also encourage folks to checkout their local indie's website. It may promote things like free in-store events, indie-exclusive editions of new books, locally self-published authors, or signed bookplates. Plus a lot of them are unionized! 

Thank you so much for supporting independent bookstores and have a wonderful new year. 💕

I have purchased all my books through bookshop.org since the scummy treatment of their employees by Amazon started surfacing. It usually takes a couple of extra days for a book to arrive, but that has made them more of a 'surprise' in the mail. 

Also, if a book you want _isn't_ available on Bookshop, it's usually because the publisher is in an anti-competitive agreement with Amazon, and you should call/email/tweet/toot the _publisher_ (never the author) to complain.

This is particularly problematic with audiobooks. My partner reads them exclusively and even with the library, has not been able to successfully avoid Audible. A ton of audiobooks are exclusive.

Have you checked out [ Libro.fm ](https://Libro.fm) ? It's like Bookshop.org but for audiobooks! 

It doesn't answer the issue of some content being exclusive to Audible, but it's a nice alternative for traditionally published audiobooks.

My partner uses our library almost exclusively. He has only used Audible once, and it's because the book was an exclusive and he was super excited about it. Other exclusives he's run into, he ultimately doesn't read, which is disheartening. I don't think we've ever come across one he wanted that the library didn't have that wasn't an Audible exclusive.

Libro has been a wonderful partner for indie bookstores! 

I can only speak to my own experience with them as a bookseller and customer (I buy audiobooks every month from them without touching the credit system), and it's been nothing but positive. 

However, I cannot speak to the author's experience! Do you have a source you could point me to? I always want to learn more.

CORRECTION: per PeterAhlstrom “It’s significantly lower than 45% of retail when you use a credit” end correction 

As a customer of libro my only complaint is getting sucked into the monthly credits & then I learned from Brandon Sanderson’s team libro only gives authors 45%. 

Could you offer instruction how to link the comment here? I’m not sure how to do it. 

Edit: “Unfortunately, Libro.FM pays a very low royalty (based on the retail price) when you use a credit. That makes sense when you set the retail price high, but not when we set it at $15 because that's what people actually pay. So we (I'm Brandon's VP of publishing) had to pass on listing the books on Libro.FM. If they change their royalty for cheap books we'll happily change that.” From [ /u/peterahlstrom ](/user/peterahlstrom)

No. I'm not interested in putting narrators and authors out of business because I don't like Amazon. For many self-published authors, in particular, they're on Audible because they can't get on other platforms.

Depending on the author they may be able to put pressure in the publisher, I’d argue against “never the author”. The author may not know. Don’t go yell at the author of course.

As long as you aren’t rude reaching out directly to the author is never bad. Sometimes you can purchase directly from them and they get a bigger cut.

Most local bookstores will also order books for you and then they get 100% of the profit. But Bookshop.org is a great alternative if you don't actually visit your local bookstores often. Our closest bookstore just links to their bookshop.org page as their online store!

Indie bookseller here— some indie bookstores have online stores as well that you can order from. I do the online orders at the bookstore I work at and it’s always a thrill to get orders from people across the country who consider us their “local” indie!

My local bookstore has said that if it’s a book they don’t carry in-store, they make the same profit from bookshop.com as they do if you order from them directly. They heavily promote bookshop for that reason.

Most indies ship even if they don't have an online store. It means calling or emailing them instead of just clicking around but like if you ask directly then they also might tell you they have a used copy, or that the book releases in paperback soon or other useful things

Reminder: Libby is still OverDrive on the backend. Libby is just the new frontend user app to replace their previous app that was named OverDrive. It's all a part of their marketing to make it "friendly". 

It was: OverDrive the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

It's now: Libby the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

EDIT: I'm not saying it's bad at all! Sorry. I'm pointing it out because a lot of people think Libby is its own service and get confused about how it's a part of OverDrive.

I worked as the store manager of an indie shop for a few years after running their online store by myself. 

Abe hardly benefits the actual book shops. It's crowded with megasellers, just like Amazon is. I would say half of listings on both sites are by HalfPriceBooks or Goodwill. Most sellers who move over 1,000 books a year online will use an automatic listing service like Neatoscan that posts on Amazon and Abe (and like 10 other sites) at the same time. 

If you want to benefit actual book stores, buy from their website, call them and buy over the phone, or go visit them in person. Bookshop gets an honorable mention, because they share 30% of the profits with the book store while hosting the site and storing the books and doing the shipping. It's incredibly generous.

I use this site as much as possible instead of Amazon. The prices are not as low as Amazon (because, Amazon) but it's seriously just as convenient, and I love supporting local stores. I'll do this for gifts as well, when I send books to niblings for birthdays/Christmas. And you can preorder stuff too! I've ordered new stuff from Penguin Random House through Bookshop and it generally comes within a day or two of the release date.

It’s not free, but I’ve always read that free shipping is a myth anyway - they just add it to the price of whatever you’re buying. I’ll pay a few bucks in shipping to benefit local shops.

Its really cool but I dont fancy paying delivery fees for already slightly more expensive books. I go to my local shops regularly but if I need something specific that they dont have - Blackwells. Free delivery on anything and 90% of the time prices are cheaper than anywhere else. And that’s why as much as I’d like, I won’t use bookshop.org 

Sadly, as of February, Blackwells is owned by Waterstones corporation. But they still have their own websites and prices and as far as I’m aware the employees are treated well. So I’d rather support them than something owned by Amazon.

But why not just order from your local bookstore's website? All Bookshop does is the same thing local bookstores do: buy the books from the publisher/distributor and then sell them to you. 

Why not give your local bookstore (or some bookstore of your choosing, if you don't have a "local") all the margin, rather than giving Bookshop a little cut? 

If for some reason I can't understand, it's Amazon or Bookshop, then by all means Bookshop. Amazon is bad. I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer, though I guess some locals just set Bookshop up as their online stores, in which case I guess Bookshop is just acting as a webhost and is charging the bookstore a fee for doing it, which is fine. 

Anyway, mostly just putting it out there that most local bookshops would be happy to ship books to you.

My local bookstore says that if it’s a book they don’t have in-store that youre picking up in-store, they make the same profit if you order from bookshop or from them directly. They promote bookshop a lot for this reason. You can always ask your local book store what works best for them.

> I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer 

In short, Bookshop is a _tool_ that good local shops can use to boost their chances of making a sale. 

Bookshop is a great resource for indie stores that focus on promoting local authors and therefore have less in-store space for James Pattersons or Colleen Hoovers. If a fan of those books passes through town, however, the bookstore can still make the sale and gain a customer through bookshop. 

It's great for niche bookstores. I visited a small bookstore in Utah once that focused on mining history, Terry Tempest Williams desert ecology stuff, and touristy coffee table books of Utah scenery. If Bookshop had been a thing then, I could have asked for a copy of A Man Called ove, and they could have said "Sorry, we don't carry that one, since it's not Utah related, _but_ you can order a copy here," and hand me a card for bookshop. 

It's also a lifesaver for used bookstores. They tend to have little control over the books they have. Of course, they decide what to keep and what to put on the shelves, but they can't just magically make Brandon Sanderson books show up. At best, they can have some kind of request system that will flag books and send a notice to a customer. Being able to still sell a book without setting up the entire enterprise of a new bookstore is a saving grace.

As a bookseller, I make about the same profit margin, don’t have to place a special order or worry about shipping/damages from my publisher, and also bookshop provides a profit pool payout twice a year in addition to those funds.

I tried buying an ebook on Bookshop.org and the experience was awful. They required downloading a third-party app which was a hassle in itself. And the reading experience was horrible. It took 3-4 taps to open a book and there was no highlighting or note taking ability. I couldn’t find an option to download an epub to manually load onto my Kindle. Then I discovered their purchase agreement doesn’t allow returns on ebooks, even though this is not disclosed during checkout. Fortunately, they did give me a refund. 

Unfortunately, this is why I stick to Kindle. 

I’d love to find another option, but I also have similar trouble finding what I’m looking for on Libby. And when they do have it, I usually have to wait weeks to check it out.

Bookshop.org is fantastic however check who you're supporting by shopping there. The first few times I ordered my money was going to Reedpop, which isn't a giant Amazon conglomerate but not what I would call a small local business. Iirc you can specify through your order who you're supporting.

I almost never buy books, because I use minimalism to help manage my ADHD. (Thank you from my bottom to the libraries!) 

But I just read Emily Nagoski's Come As You Are. I was about to suggest it to my 18-year-old, when I realized that this is the kind of book that's more like a reference text that you might want to read slowly and revisit over the years. 

So I decided to buy her a copy. And I found my local bookseller on bookshop.org! I gave her the book yesterday, and it was predictably awkward, but I told her I wished I'd had that book when I was her age. I hope she finds it helpful.

If you have a website that offers affiliate links to vendors (like a blog), then Bookshop offers better terms on commissions than Amazon and you can feel good about where you’re sending folks. This is actually one of the major reasons it was created. 

And if you don’t have a store you’d like to support, you can shop without picking, and the store commission goes into a pool shared by all the independent bookstores who are registered with the site.

Isn't using a website like this avoiding that "character" the local bookstore has? 

If you're not going in, then why's it matter what that in-store experience is to you at that point? 

And further, why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? Why shouldn't a business halfway across the country deserve to survive just as much? I've never really understood this mentality that a business deserves to survive because it hasn't found much success and grown yet, but if it did grow then it'd no longer be worth spending money at

>why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? 

I think it's because indie bookstores usually offer something additional to their communities! 

For example, the indie I work for has the only free public restroom in the shopping area (we believe it's a human right), hosts free in-store events with authors, promotes locally self-published authors, drives authors to schools for in-classroom experiences for kids, hosts a holiday book drive to replenish our local school libraries, and sponsors events across the community! 

Yes, we sell books to the people in our community, but we also try to lift up our community. I hope that makes sense.

I like supporting my community because my community supports me. It’s not a matter of deserving it or not. I want to be able to walk to a bookstore owned by someone local, and purchase a book. I want my neighbors to be able to do the same. I want to be able to go to local book events and see local authors talk.

As a bookseller, my shop supports my community and a portion of profits go back into making our city a better place. I don’t “deserve money” from anyone but when people make the choice to support our shop it stays local, funds free programs, book giveaways and more, and helps our local economy. We work with local authors, nonprofits, and vendors as well giving them a platform.

Friendly reminder that Amazon has more small and local business on it, giving you a wider selection of independent booksellers to support at a lower cost to you and a higher profit to them as Amazon takes far less than 30% of sales.

Amazon has more sellers because it is the only* platform. 

Most of the book sellers are Half Price Books or Goodwill. 

As of 2021, Amazon charged a 15% fee AND a $1.85 fee for every book sale, left you to cover shipping, and you paid for your own warehouse. So on a $10.00 book, fees are already at 33.5% BEFORE shipping and handling.   
Oh wait, there's the cost of goods as well. It's not like you're getting books for free (unless you're Goodwill). Publishers usually charge stores about 40-60% of the cover price. 

So my ten dollar book gets me 6.65 before shipping and handling, 2.65 after shipping, 2.55 after storage if I have a great deal on a warehouse, and NEGATIVE $1.45 after I pay the publisher. 

A $30.00 book will only net me $7.52 after that. From that money, I need to pay employees and invest in improvements to my store.   
Bookshop just hands my store $9.00 on that same sale, and they store and they ship. 

*I know Amazon isn't the only platform, but they've dominated to market to the point of monopoly.

Saw it’s been a few months since this website was discussed. I actually just discovered it last night. Local bookstores are so important and they have so much character we should all do what we can to support this. 

This website allows you to select a local bookstore in your area and 30% of any book purchase on the website goes to the store. 

I think it is amazing!

I'm a manager at an indie bookstore and I agree, [ Bookshop.org ](https://Bookshop.org) is wonderful! It honestly helped keep a lot of smaller indies alive during the pandemic. 

I'd also encourage folks to checkout their local indie's website. It may promote things like free in-store events, indie-exclusive editions of new books, locally self-published authors, or signed bookplates. Plus a lot of them are unionized! 

Thank you so much for supporting independent bookstores and have a wonderful new year. 💕

I have purchased all my books through bookshop.org since the scummy treatment of their employees by Amazon started surfacing. It usually takes a couple of extra days for a book to arrive, but that has made them more of a 'surprise' in the mail. 

Also, if a book you want _isn't_ available on Bookshop, it's usually because the publisher is in an anti-competitive agreement with Amazon, and you should call/email/tweet/toot the _publisher_ (never the author) to complain.

Yes! 

This is particularly problematic with audiobooks. My partner reads them exclusively and even with the library, has not been able to successfully avoid Audible. A ton of audiobooks are exclusive.

Have you checked out [ Libro.fm ](https://Libro.fm) ? It's like Bookshop.org but for audiobooks! 

It doesn't answer the issue of some content being exclusive to Audible, but it's a nice alternative for traditionally published audiobooks.

My partner uses our library almost exclusively. He has only used Audible once, and it's because the book was an exclusive and he was super excited about it. Other exclusives he's run into, he ultimately doesn't read, which is disheartening. I don't think we've ever come across one he wanted that the library didn't have that wasn't an Audible exclusive.

Libro has been a wonderful partner for indie bookstores! 

I can only speak to my own experience with them as a bookseller and customer (I buy audiobooks every month from them without touching the credit system), and it's been nothing but positive. 

However, I cannot speak to the author's experience! Do you have a source you could point me to? I always want to learn more.

CORRECTION: per PeterAhlstrom “It’s significantly lower than 45% of retail when you use a credit” end correction 

As a customer of libro my only complaint is getting sucked into the monthly credits & then I learned from Brandon Sanderson’s team libro only gives authors 45%. 

Could you offer instruction how to link the comment here? I’m not sure how to do it. 

Edit: “Unfortunately, Libro.FM pays a very low royalty (based on the retail price) when you use a credit. That makes sense when you set the retail price high, but not when we set it at $15 because that's what people actually pay. So we (I'm Brandon's VP of publishing) had to pass on listing the books on Libro.FM. If they change their royalty for cheap books we'll happily change that.” From [ /u/peterahlstrom ](/user/peterahlstrom)

No. I'm not interested in putting narrators and authors out of business because I don't like Amazon. For many self-published authors, in particular, they're on Audible because they can't get on other platforms.

Depending on the author they may be able to put pressure in the publisher, I’d argue against “never the author”. The author may not know. Don’t go yell at the author of course.

As long as you aren’t rude reaching out directly to the author is never bad. Sometimes you can purchase directly from them and they get a bigger cut.

Most local bookstores will also order books for you and then they get 100% of the profit. But Bookshop.org is a great alternative if you don't actually visit your local bookstores often. Our closest bookstore just links to their bookshop.org page as their online store!

Indie bookseller here— some indie bookstores have online stores as well that you can order from. I do the online orders at the bookstore I work at and it’s always a thrill to get orders from people across the country who consider us their “local” indie!

My local bookstore has said that if it’s a book they don’t carry in-store, they make the same profit from bookshop.com as they do if you order from them directly. They heavily promote bookshop for that reason.

Most indies ship even if they don't have an online store. It means calling or emailing them instead of just clicking around but like if you ask directly then they also might tell you they have a used copy, or that the book releases in paperback soon or other useful things

Reminder: Libby is still OverDrive on the backend. Libby is just the new frontend user app to replace their previous app that was named OverDrive. It's all a part of their marketing to make it "friendly". 

It was: OverDrive the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

It's now: Libby the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

EDIT: I'm not saying it's bad at all! Sorry. I'm pointing it out because a lot of people think Libby is its own service and get confused about how it's a part of OverDrive.

I worked as the store manager of an indie shop for a few years after running their online store by myself. 

Abe hardly benefits the actual book shops. It's crowded with megasellers, just like Amazon is. I would say half of listings on both sites are by HalfPriceBooks or Goodwill. Most sellers who move over 1,000 books a year online will use an automatic listing service like Neatoscan that posts on Amazon and Abe (and like 10 other sites) at the same time. 

If you want to benefit actual book stores, buy from their website, call them and buy over the phone, or go visit them in person. Bookshop gets an honorable mention, because they share 30% of the profits with the book store while hosting the site and storing the books and doing the shipping. It's incredibly generous.

I use this site as much as possible instead of Amazon. The prices are not as low as Amazon (because, Amazon) but it's seriously just as convenient, and I love supporting local stores. I'll do this for gifts as well, when I send books to niblings for birthdays/Christmas. And you can preorder stuff too! I've ordered new stuff from Penguin Random House through Bookshop and it generally comes within a day or two of the release date.

It’s not free, but I’ve always read that free shipping is a myth anyway - they just add it to the price of whatever you’re buying. I’ll pay a few bucks in shipping to benefit local shops.

Its really cool but I dont fancy paying delivery fees for already slightly more expensive books. I go to my local shops regularly but if I need something specific that they dont have - Blackwells. Free delivery on anything and 90% of the time prices are cheaper than anywhere else. And that’s why as much as I’d like, I won’t use bookshop.org 

Sadly, as of February, Blackwells is owned by Waterstones corporation. But they still have their own websites and prices and as far as I’m aware the employees are treated well. So I’d rather support them than something owned by Amazon.

But why not just order from your local bookstore's website? All Bookshop does is the same thing local bookstores do: buy the books from the publisher/distributor and then sell them to you. 

Why not give your local bookstore (or some bookstore of your choosing, if you don't have a "local") all the margin, rather than giving Bookshop a little cut? 

If for some reason I can't understand, it's Amazon or Bookshop, then by all means Bookshop. Amazon is bad. I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer, though I guess some locals just set Bookshop up as their online stores, in which case I guess Bookshop is just acting as a webhost and is charging the bookstore a fee for doing it, which is fine. 

Anyway, mostly just putting it out there that most local bookshops would be happy to ship books to you.

My local bookstore says that if it’s a book they don’t have in-store that youre picking up in-store, they make the same profit if you order from bookshop or from them directly. They promote bookshop a lot for this reason. You can always ask your local book store what works best for them.

> I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer 

In short, Bookshop is a _tool_ that good local shops can use to boost their chances of making a sale. 

Bookshop is a great resource for indie stores that focus on promoting local authors and therefore have less in-store space for James Pattersons or Colleen Hoovers. If a fan of those books passes through town, however, the bookstore can still make the sale and gain a customer through bookshop. 

It's great for niche bookstores. I visited a small bookstore in Utah once that focused on mining history, Terry Tempest Williams desert ecology stuff, and touristy coffee table books of Utah scenery. If Bookshop had been a thing then, I could have asked for a copy of A Man Called ove, and they could have said "Sorry, we don't carry that one, since it's not Utah related, _but_ you can order a copy here," and hand me a card for bookshop. 

It's also a lifesaver for used bookstores. They tend to have little control over the books they have. Of course, they decide what to keep and what to put on the shelves, but they can't just magically make Brandon Sanderson books show up. At best, they can have some kind of request system that will flag books and send a notice to a customer. Being able to still sell a book without setting up the entire enterprise of a new bookstore is a saving grace.

As a bookseller, I make about the same profit margin, don’t have to place a special order or worry about shipping/damages from my publisher, and also bookshop provides a profit pool payout twice a year in addition to those funds.

I tried buying an ebook on Bookshop.org and the experience was awful. They required downloading a third-party app which was a hassle in itself. And the reading experience was horrible. It took 3-4 taps to open a book and there was no highlighting or note taking ability. I couldn’t find an option to download an epub to manually load onto my Kindle. Then I discovered their purchase agreement doesn’t allow returns on ebooks, even though this is not disclosed during checkout. Fortunately, they did give me a refund. 

Unfortunately, this is why I stick to Kindle. 

I’d love to find another option, but I also have similar trouble finding what I’m looking for on Libby. And when they do have it, I usually have to wait weeks to check it out.

Bookshop.org is fantastic however check who you're supporting by shopping there. The first few times I ordered my money was going to Reedpop, which isn't a giant Amazon conglomerate but not what I would call a small local business. Iirc you can specify through your order who you're supporting.

I almost never buy books, because I use minimalism to help manage my ADHD. (Thank you from my bottom to the libraries!) 

But I just read Emily Nagoski's Come As You Are. I was about to suggest it to my 18-year-old, when I realized that this is the kind of book that's more like a reference text that you might want to read slowly and revisit over the years. 

So I decided to buy her a copy. And I found my local bookseller on bookshop.org! I gave her the book yesterday, and it was predictably awkward, but I told her I wished I'd had that book when I was her age. I hope she finds it helpful.

If you have a website that offers affiliate links to vendors (like a blog), then Bookshop offers better terms on commissions than Amazon and you can feel good about where you’re sending folks. This is actually one of the major reasons it was created. 

And if you don’t have a store you’d like to support, you can shop without picking, and the store commission goes into a pool shared by all the independent bookstores who are registered with the site.

Isn't using a website like this avoiding that "character" the local bookstore has? 

If you're not going in, then why's it matter what that in-store experience is to you at that point? 

And further, why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? Why shouldn't a business halfway across the country deserve to survive just as much? I've never really understood this mentality that a business deserves to survive because it hasn't found much success and grown yet, but if it did grow then it'd no longer be worth spending money at

>why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? 

I think it's because indie bookstores usually offer something additional to their communities! 

For example, the indie I work for has the only free public restroom in the shopping area (we believe it's a human right), hosts free in-store events with authors, promotes locally self-published authors, drives authors to schools for in-classroom experiences for kids, hosts a holiday book drive to replenish our local school libraries, and sponsors events across the community! 

Yes, we sell books to the people in our community, but we also try to lift up our community. I hope that makes sense.

I like supporting my community because my community supports me. It’s not a matter of deserving it or not. I want to be able to walk to a bookstore owned by someone local, and purchase a book. I want my neighbors to be able to do the same. I want to be able to go to local book events and see local authors talk.

As a bookseller, my shop supports my community and a portion of profits go back into making our city a better place. I don’t “deserve money” from anyone but when people make the choice to support our shop it stays local, funds free programs, book giveaways and more, and helps our local economy. We work with local authors, nonprofits, and vendors as well giving them a platform.

Friendly reminder that Amazon has more small and local business on it, giving you a wider selection of independent booksellers to support at a lower cost to you and a higher profit to them as Amazon takes far less than 30% of sales.

Amazon has more sellers because it is the only* platform. 

Most of the book sellers are Half Price Books or Goodwill. 

As of 2021, Amazon charged a 15% fee AND a $1.85 fee for every book sale, left you to cover shipping, and you paid for your own warehouse. So on a $10.00 book, fees are already at 33.5% BEFORE shipping and handling.   
Oh wait, there's the cost of goods as well. It's not like you're getting books for free (unless you're Goodwill). Publishers usually charge stores about 40-60% of the cover price. 

So my ten dollar book gets me 6.65 before shipping and handling, 2.65 after shipping, 2.55 after storage if I have a great deal on a warehouse, and NEGATIVE $1.45 after I pay the publisher. 

A $30.00 book will only net me $7.52 after that. From that money, I need to pay employees and invest in improvements to my store.   
Bookshop just hands my store $9.00 on that same sale, and they store and they ship. 

*I know Amazon isn't the only platform, but they've dominated to market to the point of monopoly.
