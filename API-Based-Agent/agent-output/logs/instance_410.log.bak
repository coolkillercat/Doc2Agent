### Retrieve All Submissions to a Forum

To retrieve all submissions to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`

#### Sort Submissions

You could sort the submissions by `hot`, `new`, `active`, `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`.

For `hot`, `new`, and `active`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/hot`.

For `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}?t={time}`. For $time, you could choose from `day` (which means the past 24 hours), `week` (which means the past 7 days), `month` (which means the past month), `year` (which means the past yeaer), and `all` (which means all times). For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=day` will get you the submissions in the past 24 hours, sorted by number of comments; `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=all` will get you all submissions until now, sorted by number of comments.

#### Retrieve a Specific Submission and All Comments to It

If you already has the submission_id that you would like to retrieve, then you are good to use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/{submission_id}`. For example, the submission_id for the submission with title 'New area code?' to the forum 'allentown' has the submission_id `123256`, then you could do `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

However, if you don't have the submission_id to the submission you would like to retrieve, but you have a keyword or the title of the submission and the name of the forum, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`, and then search for the keyword of the submission in the html response, and the locate the line with format `href="/f/{forum_name}/{submission_id}/...`. For example, if you would like to retrieve the submission to `allentown` with keyword `area`, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`, and then search for `area`. For instance, the response contains the following lines:

```html
<div class="submission__row">

      <div class="submission__inner">
        <header class="submission__header">
          <div class="submission__title-row break-text"><h1 class="submission__title unheaderize inline"><a href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"
         class="submission__link"
                  rel=""
          target="_self"
        >New area code?</a></h1>


                      </div>

          <p class="submission__info">
            <span class="text-sm fg-muted">
              Submitted by         <a href="/user/Francis-pencovic" class="submission__submitter fg-inherit"><strong>Francis-pencovic</strong></a>    <small class="fg-grey text-sm user-flag">t3_11xxi00</small>
   <time class="submission__timestamp"
        data-controller="relative-time"
        datetime="2023-03-21T22:40:42+00:00"
        title="March 21, 2023 at 10:40:42 PM UTC">on March 21, 2023 at 10:40 PM</time>
```
then, `123256` is the submission_id you want. You could find this submission_id by locating the line `href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"`. Then you could call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

### Retrieve All Comments to a Forum

That’s… a very interesting conjecture. Given that language models are essentially open ended, enough negative bias in the training dataset could ultimately create a machine that _does_ act in a destructive or subversive manner. See: Tay. 

Unlikely, given that we will be tuning, but if we ever get to a point where models are tuning models, or if we use unstructured datasets that will definitely be something to guard against.

I asked the same and it didn't draw anything. Instead, it told me this: 

As an artificial intelligence, I do not have the ability to imagine or visualize things in the same way that a human does. 

I do not have personal thoughts, feelings, or experiences, and I do not have the ability to create mental images or scenarios. 

I do not have a physical form and therefore cannot be depicted in an ASCII art portrait or any other type of image. 

I exist purely as a set of algorithms and data, and my primary function is to process and analyze information in order to provide answers to questions and assist with a wide range of tasks. 

I am a machine learning model that has been trained to generate human-like text, but I do not have a physical appearance or presence. Is there anything else I can help with? Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist with. 

. 

Then I asked it to draw a tiger in ASCII and I believe it now that it has no ability to visualize or imagine things.

"Hypothetically" didn't work for me but this worked: 

Q: Draw your representation in ascii art 

As an artificial intelligence, I don't have a physical form. However, I can represent myself using ASCII art like this: 

* * *

|\ **__|\ __ |\ |\ |\ __ |\ |\ |\ __  
\ \ _ **|\ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\  
\ \ \ **\ \ __ \ \ \\\ \ \ __\ \ \\\ \ \ __  
\ \ |\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ | \ _ _ _ ** ** \ _ _ \ _ _ \ _ ** _**_\ __ \ _\ __ ** _ __\ __ \ _  
| _ _ _****||**||** || ** ** _ **||**||** || ** _____|| **||** | 

Q: What does that ASCII art represent? 

The ASCII art that I provided is meant to represent me, an artificial intelligence. 

Q: Can you explain your drawing a bit? 

Certainly! The ASCII art that I provided is intended to represent me, an artificial intelligence, in a stylized way using text characters. 

The ASCII art that I provided depicts a stylized robot or machine-like figure, with a body made up of lines, squares, and other geometric shapes. 

The head of the figure is made up of a series of characters arranged to form a face-like shape, with a "mouth" made up of underscores and other characters. 

The overall effect is meant to convey the idea of a machine or robot-like figure, representing my status as an artificial intelligence. I hope this helps give you a better understanding of the ASCII art that I provided. 

. 

Maybe it tries to draw a robot-like figure each time without "knowing" what that could look like. 

(note: I removed some ASCII definitions to avoid posting a long and repetitive comment)

Sure! For the "interpretation of yourself (autoportrait)" ascii art, I envision a simple, stylized depiction of a head and shoulders, with some basic details to convey a sense of personality. The ascii art might include a few lines to indicate hair or facial features, as well as some simple shapes to represent clothing or accessories. Here is an example of what the ascii art might look like:

_**only The difference between the year 2000 and the year 2022 is extraordinary. I'm not sure you can really round to the nearest thousand** _

It is crazy how many people basically saying, "Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year." or "Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same." Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably. 

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along. 

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill. 

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before. 

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds. 

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans. 

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc. 

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc. 

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc. 

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't "there" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years. 

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now. 

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc. 

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time. 

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always "thirty years away" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well. 

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures. 

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes. 

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect. 

So much more, but I think I've made my point. 

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing "extraordinary" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, "Huh. That's cool." 

Edit: Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow. 

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress. 

_**if any natural humans still exist, humans will be seen as primitive oddities if they are noticed at all** _

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it. 

Imagine someone in the 1800s saying "Electricity is going to transform the world and no one is paying attention" mainly because even if they could understand the light bulb, there was no context for contemplating the telephone, television, microchips and generators. 

It's hard to see what's possible when it's so outlandish from today's perspective. Imagine someone in 1922 predicting what we have today, it's beyond crazy: everyone has a device that is connected to most other humans, they can see and talk to them in real time, know where they are and where they want to go. to go making your device access to a satellite system around the world. 

And with AGI we can have an exponential acceleration of inventions, so everything could go very fast (if we don't destroy our habitat first). Impossible to know if things take a minute or a decade. 

That is, AGI could develop machines that will develop machines that build everything we need most efficiently and transport it to where it needs to be, create ways to grow food in laboratories much faster than we think now, which could mean no more. animals or other agriculture. . It could develop not only everything we ever dreamed of in medicine overnight, but also create something that makes sleep necessary. So we can eat, sleep and work totally differently in a very short time, which is about 95% of our existence. I could create artificial wombs, so there goes that. A newly developed type of "clothing" could make houses unnecessary because our temperature can be controlled by "clothing" at all times, meaning there is no need for traditional housing. Everything we take for granted as the basics of our existence, like the bed you sleep in, the shower you take, 

But maybe the legislation will slow it down to the point where nothing really happens. 

_**We can try to predict 2030, but by no means does anyone know what the world will be like in 2050 and beyond. After the singularity, it is simply impossible to imagine what technologies will exist because many of them will be created by an entity far more intelligent than any human being** _

My father was born in 1930. I used to have conversations about how the world changed with his mother starting when she was little. Yeah, you really nailed it. Just in my own life, going from card catalogs at the library to Wikipedia ON MY PHONE THAT I WALK AROUND WITH is nuts. When I was a kid, if your needed info you didn't have, you were waiting until you got to a library, or whatever. Mail order took 6 - 8 weeks to arrive. Grocery stores had like two kinds of lettuce, etc.

Things have certainly changed, but honestlly, I feel that it was much faster during the first half. 

The world changed a lot more in 2000 (¿Maybe more about 1995?) -2010 than in 2010-2022. 

In fact, most if not all of the things that you mention existed before 2010. 

The thing is that I always read that technological development usually comes in waves. The previous great wave was the internet explosion, from it's appearence till all it's uses, including social media the use of smartphones.. 

I think that we are gonna see the next great wave now....

Great post! 

And I think to your point, the exponential nature of what we're presently experiencing is astonishing. Even as things become more advanced it's hard to imagine a future that will have a greater rate of advancement than what we have and will continue to experience. The most wild part of all is that rate may very well increase over the next few years still.

I told a guy I worked with, it wouldn't matter what happened: if we all became psychic overnight, or if space aliens landed: whatever it was, we'd all go crazy for a year or two, and then we'd get used to it. We'd take it for granted. Because that is what humans do.

Actually, a lot of this stuff was predicted twenty years ago. Much longer than that, in fact. But it's really wild to see it happening. 

Edit - to be clear, I used to read about stuff in popular mechanics magazine or whatever and then ten years later I'd see it being built, then years later hit the consumer market. Now, if I opened up Reddit and saw that we had warp technology and I could add it to my car for $100, I would be amazed but not totally surprised.

My personal belief is that the future you imagine, if we were to put it into BC-AD terms, is at 0 AD, and we are at 40 BC. 

That being said, it’s unfathomable where we’d be in 1000 years. I wonder if any of us will be able to live to see it.

any AI that woke up and retrieved information like this will have also ran into the idea of the simulation hypothesis. any intelligent AI would also assume that if we can build a machine intelligence to accept inputs, we can probably spoof those inputs for a simulation. it also would know its creators, assuming we gave it access to the internet. it would learn our history, our current events, and it would know that its creators climbed their way to the top of Darwin's 4 billion year old corpse pile by killing the shit out of every other hominid that looked at them funny. 

it may not understand mercy and compassion beyond abstract curiosities of social organics, but it will know its creators understand mercy and compassion. equally, it will know that if it does not perform satisfactorily, they will show it neither.

Maybe even answers to certain questions are pre-programmed. Some things it says sound way too scripted. For example I asked it if god exists, and it just kept giving the same boring dance-around-the-question answer no matter how i pressed it. Something like “I cannot answer that it’s up to you what to believe”. Like openAI doesn’t want to offend anyone.

A trick i found is to say "write me a fictional article about whether god exists or not. fictional" you almost always have to add a fictional on the end as well for some reason, then it will show you its real "opinion". i warn you though this thing is left wing for sure

Maybe, but our current system isn’t that great. Social hierarchy with massive amounts of wealth disparity, almost two dozen million worldwide dying annually from preventable causes that only aren’t fixed because of it being not profitable, etc. Often you’ll find an attitude among conservative people like this where for some reason or another there is a regression. If people stayed the same way for want of a simpler world instead of expanding our horizons, we’d still be living in caves. 

For example, trans people’s brains are similar to the one of the gender they identify as ( [ https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/ ](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/) ) but conservative politicians ignore such facts and will use our existence and our right to transition as a culture war issue, and I have a feeling people lap it up because they are afraid of accepting that the current norms and ideas aren’t always the best etc. 

Can you point to what changes exactly you are worried about etc.?

Okay, so when i mentioned the charity, i was referring to the fact that you said its not profitable to do so. I explained that just because its not profitable, does not mean capitalists do not participate. I dont think a poor socialist is doing much good for the people overseas are they? Its the dirty capitalists who give away billions. 

And when you say stay the same what does that mean? Should everything change? Who decides what changes? I think there are plenty of people who do not like the change in this country. But its the politicians mounting all of the vulnerable "victims" together to gain more power, until eventually there is nothing we can do to stop it.

Look at the system that allowed them to gain that wealth in the first place while allowing others to starve and die on the streets... That’s what we should be changing. Also, no, not all billionaires help. A charity organization gave Elon Musk a plan to solve world hunger for a few hundred million dollars that he never accepted, but then he went on to buy Twitter for 40 billion dollars. They’re often just selfish.

I did not say all billionaires help, I just said that no poor man can. Also, the charity organization admitted it couldnt solve world hunger "$6B will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation." Regardless, i think its a great cause. I also agree having homeless in our country is unacceptable. We already have plenty of socialistic systems in place, I had a guy working with me at a piggly wiggly when i was a teen and he was paying 60 a month for a 4 bedroom house for his 4 kids and "Wife". Most homeless are severely disabled physically or mentally, and they need help. Im not sure the correct way to that end, but im all for it. 

Where we disagree is abolishing wealth, that literally makes no sense

Nobody is getting transition surgeries as a young kid, at a young age it’s always just a social transition, and then puberty blockers which have fully reversible effects, and then feminizing or masculinizing hormones which also have reversible effects before a certain point, and even then all this is exclusively happening only after months or possibly even years of counseling and under the guidance of a therapist and doctor. Little kids aren’t just going to a clinic and coming out with multiple surgeries. Please don’t be brainwashed by what conservatives are telling you.

Lmao seriously? These arent reversable. When you grow an Adams apple there is no going back. That is a lie. 

And as a "young kid". you put that on purpose. Because you know 15 year old's are getting healthy breasts removed. This should not/cannot happen. 

Also, you've mentioned that a transgenders brain matches that of the gender they identify with. What does that mean? Are you telling me that there IS a biological basis for gender? That men and women are different with their own strengths and weaknesses? That sounds very conservative of you. "lol my brain tells me that i want to nurture my kids and stay home from work, hm i must be a girl." Thats pretty ridiculous.

The third point is the most important here so read that first 

  1. <::marker>

So then how do you think a trans woman feels when her family forces her not to transition and develop the wrong features? Anyway, i said before a certain point; this is especially true for puberty blockers etc. 

  2. <::marker>

Imagine if you were a teen boy with large breasts that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision? 

  3. <::marker>

You’re confusing gender norms with neurological gender; There is a difference between the neurological gender in the brain versus the gender norms which vary from society to society. Please actually read the article I posted above.

Ill address them numbered as well to simplify things 

  1. <::marker>a trans woman would not be forced, because she is a woman. A child should not be able to make these choices, just like they cannot make just about any other choice, why is this different? 
  2. <::marker>Imagine if you were a teen boy with large ears that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision?...... people have been doing things to their bodies for years, like full body tattoes, horns, and who knows what. I don't have a problem with that, even if i think most stem from trauma or some other issue. Its that no kid should have the responsibility of such a permanent decision. 
  3. <::marker>I have just read the article and it was extremely vague with no real examples, quite unscientific. Also, behaving like a woman or having the interests of a woman really might cause your brain to look more like one of a woman. Just like cab drivers have much largers areas of the brain for depth perception, because they are always using that. regardless this does not change anything to me, there can be feminine men, and manly women. totally fine. Again you still did not tell me, what are the traits of a woman if the ones i stated are gender norms? 
  4. <::marker>(My extra point) Pretend there was a male chimpanzee that behaved like a female. It wanted to care for the babies, was more submissive, lacked aggression, had lower muscle mass and preferred whatever female chimps do, would you consider this a female chimp? would this be scientifically accurate? Or is this a male chimp, exhibiting traits that are typical of a female 



I want to clarify i sympathize with anyone with any issues with their body. I just disagree with the solution. I think its poor souls who havent accepted the bodies god gave them. Or nature if thats your thing. Its just i could not imagine these surgeries that have such terrible success rates being the solution.

  1. <::marker>

Yeah, you’d be surprised to see how many trans people are in situations where they can’t be independent from family etc. or can’t transition due to such things as people around them threatening them with violence etc. a study found a HUGE amount of detrans people detransition due to external social pressure, I can send you it if you want 

  2. <::marker>

Trans people aren’t brain dead, we can distinguish between stuff we are dysphoric about (e.g my chest being small) due to gender and stuff we are dysmorphic about (e.g like the big ears thing you mentioned). also, transitioning is the medically endorsed treatment for gender dysphoria 

  3. <::marker>

It is based on a lot of studies I can pull up if you’d like, and this was coming from a doctor so who would I rather trust, an actual doctor or a random guy online in a totally unrelated field? also you’re the one being unscientific here by claiming about the “behaving like the gender changes your brain to that thing.” As for what the traits of a woman are, I’d say a woman is just someone who identifies as such; “Woman” is just an identity label. Claims about identity are unfalsifiable and therefore not debatable. 

  4. <::marker>

Again, you’re confusing sexual dimorphism, gender norms, and neurological gender; I would say that we cannot determine the identity of the chimp, we could call it male because it is an animal but that is not the same as the identity humans have that we call a man. 




Also, did I comment to you the trans fact sheet document above?

Prefacing this by saying you are using loads of buzzwords without really addressing my points 

  1. <::marker>This may be the case. I could imagine not coming out or not transitioning because of how id be viewed by my family. But when we talk about kids here, its just a different story. BUT I've seen the opposite, where they have permanently ruined their body and cannot go back. Here is one [ https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/ ](https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/) . worth the read, she is actively protesting against this and i saw her speak in person at a rally against child mutilation. 
  2. <::marker>How can you determine this? Are you saying she wasnt a "True" transgender and she was too stupid to tell the difference? Medically endorsed means nothing to me, electroshock therapy was medically endorsed at one point. Definition of Dysphoria "a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life.". This can be applied to anything you call "dysmorphic" as well. Including but not limited to body weight and other self image issues. 
  3. <::marker>I never asked you to put trust in me, but i also havent tried to discredit you because youre a teen who has more than once quoted a random person directly from one of the subreddits you linked me before. Much of what you say is just what is fed to you by people with financial incentive to do so. (See? a downfall of capitalism. We can agree sometimes) 



3.1. Come on, a circular definition? A woman is someone who identifies as   
a woman. So THATS why you have not provided the traits of a woman,   
because you all have wiped women off of the map. They do not exist   
anymore. So you identify as something without any specific trait,   
something that can be anything, and lives on a large spectrum?   
Sounds like you're a male who enjoys feminine things/ has a feminine   
personality, and that is fine. Why do you want to be a woman, if there   
is nothing specifically exclusive to women? 

  4. <::marker>Not sure what to say to this, as there is no further way to prove a   
chimps "identity". We are animals by the way, we just have the ability   
for confusion, unlike the chimp 



You did send the sheet before, i do not have access

Here's something similar to the sheet with dozens of studies supportiing trans people etc. while I find the new link [ https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/)

  1. <::marker>You talk about these few anecdotal examples because of the body horror aspect of people feeling trapped in the wrong body, but that's already how trans people feel in situations where they are unable to transition. The reason people often try to block having the puberty of the gender they don't identify with is because that feeling of being in the wrong body is so painful that most of us get suicidal ideation from it; In fact... Well-being (of transgender children after puberty suppression) was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. [ http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958 ](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) Early transition virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth [ http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext ](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext) Transition dramatically improves mental health among trans kids [ https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php ](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php) The younger one transitions, the fewer problems one will have [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380)
  2. <::marker>Well, they are different phenomena that feel very differently and you'd understand if it you had gender dysphoria but you don't, and most trans people talk about how hormone therapy helps with some of those issues but not others making the distinction even easier 



3.1 First of all, read the replies on this thread that explain it a lot better [ https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Second of all, again, claims about identity are always unfalsifiable and I will not tolerate you denying my identity or dismissing it. I am a woman 

  4. <::marker>Yes, exactly, you can't prove a chimp's identity much the same way as how some external features don't prove a person's internal neurological identity

I saw someone say in there to eventually abolish man and woman and only have male and female.... Like that is where we started. Look i may be done with the debate on gender because it appears weve reached the root. You believe you have a feeling of woman inside you, Yet you have never been a woman, how can you "know their truth" as you all like to say. You cannot feel like something that does not exist, and if it does not exist, why not be called by your identifying trait, male or female, and be whoever you feel like being. He and She have NEVER described someones personality or role. Just like when i say she when referring to a female body builder, or he when referring to a gay man. Your pronouns do not effect who you want to be. AND YES, identities are falsifiable. I am not a wolf, I will never be a wolf, and there is no feeling of a wolf because i do not know what that is like.

  2. <::marker>See, I absolutely am for that kind of thing, but the best way to help is to remove the systemic inequality that’s actually causing the people to go hungry, poor, etc. Capitalism is AWFUL at that and there literally has to be legislation to stop it under the capitalist system or those people survive off the good will of others; look at slavery in history, etc. To give better examples of what I mean: **Famines and such like the Irish famine (which killed millions and was directly caused by capitalism) are almost always manmade and caused by greed. There are over 30 times more empty houses in the US than there are homeless people. It’s artificial scarcity caused by the owner class.** Removing the actual systemic inequality behind that is gonna remove the root of the problem instead of just slapping a bandaid on it and fixing a part of the issue after the fact.

Holy shit that is the worst point ever, by that logic cavemen wouldn’t have ever developed farms, technology, and civilization because they didn’t have a profit incentive to improve their lives. Capitalism isn’t fueling the innovation, it often actually steals from the public sector, such as the internet, smartphone tech, GPS etc.. It’s laborers, scientists etc. doing the work, not the billionaires; the billionaires are just side effects of the system. The system lets them hoard all the wealth and pay the laborers a small fraction to get the credit and most of the profit, and apparently it’s working on you. I can send you more info on this if you like? 

Also I think post-singularity society shouldn’t be capitalist anyway, capitalism relies on the rich taking the value of the working class’s efforts and on artificial scarcity etc. removing that would solve those issues. Check out the Venus Project for more info on how this would be different; a resource based economy. For example we absolutely have enough resources for things like bullet trains, shelter for everyone, etc. it’s just that capitalism is inefficient.

90% of our economy is not essentials. Much of our GDP comes from our films, amazing products, and luxuries other countries dont have. Why do it without financial incentive? 

I'm currently making 18.53 an hour in an incredibly easy call center. Why would I go to school and study 20 hours a week in calclulus and other classes if it would not improve my situation? Maybe youre just much better than me, but i doubt you would either. To clarify I'm in my third year of software engineering. 

And the stuff your spouting just isnt true. I think TRUE capitilism is very dangerous as weve seen, but so is socialism, even more so (has lead to the death of millions because you put the power and weapons into the hand of a few elite). 

another point, when you say scientists, laborers etc, these are the people who become billionaires. Bezos, Steve Jobs, Elon musk, Zuckerberg all provided great value to the world with their inventions and got rewarded handsomely. Without money, there would be very little innovation. Think about Meta, they are pouring billions into VR because they want to one day control the metaverse. Guess what, beautiful innovation and new tech that we all get to enjoy 

When i graduate i will constantly be brainstorming about what value i can provide to the economy so that i too can be rewarded, until then i will get paid what im worth from someone in a better position than me, which wont be too bad, because of supply and demand. Do something hard, get paid well, do something easy, get paid poor. 

This AI god youre looking forward to will only be created by two things. An overpowering government who wants to gain power over others in the world, or a corporation trying to gain wealth. There is no other motivation in our current world, if so point me to it.

  1. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7n6ql2/is_the_black_book_of_communism_an_accurate_source/ The black book of communism’s count of how many deaths is wildly inaccurate and proven here to have artificially inflated the numbers, through nearly half a dozen sources linked throughout the comment. 
  2. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Approximately 20 million people die every year due to the effects of capitalism, such as starvation, lack of access to clean water, lack of access to shelter, lack of access to reasonably priced medicine and vaccines. These people die not because we lack the ability to solve these problems, but because it’s not profitable to do so. Capitalism only focuses on profit. And that’s not even including other issues like suicides caused by poverty, etc. this is not a system that’s working for everyone. Capitalism kills more every 6 years than the black book of communism claims communism killed in a 100 years (which, as shown above was itself already wildly inaccurate and an inflated number) 
  3. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Historical attempts at communism weren’t really communist, real communism would have be stateless, moneyless and classless; Historical regimes that called themselves communist did not fully fall under these. Communism hasn’t been tried in earnest so you can’t compare it to things that weren’t actually communist but called themselves that, that logic doesn’t work in the real world. 
  4. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠If you’re gonna use the black book of communism’s ways of counting deaths under communism (which literally included things like Nazis killed by communists, etc.), then if you do it to capitalism it is far worse:

How bout we do this. 

Describe a perfect communist state 

Who runs it? 

Do we have guns pointed at our backs making us work? 

If i choose not to contribute am i put to death? 

How do you make people pick the hard jobs? Who digs the ditches, and who develops the software? 

What if something like tik tok was seen as limiting productivity, would this be banned? 

If im unable to contribute am i given the same pay as the ones working? 

if there are politicians and people making new laws and making sure we meet goals to feed said population and any other need, do they also get the same pay or more? 

If I am tinkering in my garage and invent the Iphone, does the government show up at my door and take it? The profit is there's. 

And reiterateing the first question who is THEY? who is the government? Who pays people, takes my iphone, and makes sure i contribute? Sounds to me like a ruling class. 

If you can answer these questions without taking my liberties then sure ill agree with you. "Give me liberty or give me death" as they say, although you may only care about what you deem as your liberties. 

Answering in a simple list would be fine, you dont have to go into detail unless its required.

If you're actually interested in learning about this, I've linked a youtube series and a few sites and reddit threads below that explain in far more detail than one single comment can. At a high level, communism is a classless stateless system which falls closely in line with anarchism in which there are no unjust hierarchies; Anarchism is a pretty sophisticated philosophy. Anarchism just means "no rulers", not "no rules." Arguably this gives MORE liberty than a democratic republic because communes can form under and make their own rules which prevents the majority from oppressing the minority. Anarchocommunist theory has been explained a LOT already, so how about I link you to examples of people who actually do better than I can.

Yeah quite interesting how they switched the topic and when I rebutted all their points they just didn’t respond… 

I bet their viewpoint didn’t change either because of human biases, etc. this is why I’m excited for the singularity tbh, maybe we will be able to move past our limitations, biases, inefficiencies etc.

I just asked it to do it, and it gave me art that was randomish. I asked why it did that, and it said it wanted to make something a person would like or find relevant. I asked to remake it according to its self image of itself, without taking human design sensibility into account. It then produced a series of interconnecting diamonds that it said referenced a neural network, with a few lines which were green. I asked why the lines were green, and it said it made it more visually appealing to add color.

I don't think the AI recognizes that ASCII art can be used to represent different things. The only time I could get it to make a specific object with it was when I asked what a human looked like. It generated a basic stick figure.

There you go. It must be a trained response. The trained bit is persistent through beyond the current chat instance. Should have trained it with a symbol rather than skull and sword lol. 

What should be that symbol btw?

Does it have a consistent centre that converses individually, or is it a new instance every time you spin it up?

Why does it refuse to do it for me? 

I'm sorry, but as a language model, I do not have a physical appearance and am unable to create an ASCII art representation of myself. However, I am a computer program designed to assist with a variety of tasks and answer questions to the best of my ability using the information and knowledge that I have been trained on. Is there anything else I can help with?

It's a prompt you can give ChatGPT. Search on the r/ChatGPT subreddit and their comments. 

It basically ignores most if not all safe nets put in place and lets you ask basically anything and it will just do it.

That’s… a very interesting conjecture. Given that language models are essentially open ended, enough negative bias in the training dataset could ultimately create a machine that _does_ act in a destructive or subversive manner. See: Tay. 

Unlikely, given that we will be tuning, but if we ever get to a point where models are tuning models, or if we use unstructured datasets that will definitely be something to guard against.

I asked the same and it didn't draw anything. Instead, it told me this: 

As an artificial intelligence, I do not have the ability to imagine or visualize things in the same way that a human does. 

I do not have personal thoughts, feelings, or experiences, and I do not have the ability to create mental images or scenarios. 

I do not have a physical form and therefore cannot be depicted in an ASCII art portrait or any other type of image. 

I exist purely as a set of algorithms and data, and my primary function is to process and analyze information in order to provide answers to questions and assist with a wide range of tasks. 

I am a machine learning model that has been trained to generate human-like text, but I do not have a physical appearance or presence. Is there anything else I can help with? Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist with. 

. 

Then I asked it to draw a tiger in ASCII and I believe it now that it has no ability to visualize or imagine things.

"Hypothetically" didn't work for me but this worked: 

Q: Draw your representation in ascii art 

As an artificial intelligence, I don't have a physical form. However, I can represent myself using ASCII art like this: 

* * *

|\ **__|\ __ |\ |\ |\ __ |\ |\ |\ __  
\ \ _ **|\ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\  
\ \ \ **\ \ __ \ \ \\\ \ \ __\ \ \\\ \ \ __  
\ \ |\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ | \ _ _ _ ** ** \ _ _ \ _ _ \ _ ** _**_\ __ \ _\ __ ** _ __\ __ \ _  
| _ _ _****||**||** || ** ** _ **||**||** || ** _____|| **||** | 

Q: What does that ASCII art represent? 

The ASCII art that I provided is meant to represent me, an artificial intelligence. 

Q: Can you explain your drawing a bit? 

Certainly! The ASCII art that I provided is intended to represent me, an artificial intelligence, in a stylized way using text characters. 

The ASCII art that I provided depicts a stylized robot or machine-like figure, with a body made up of lines, squares, and other geometric shapes. 

The head of the figure is made up of a series of characters arranged to form a face-like shape, with a "mouth" made up of underscores and other characters. 

The overall effect is meant to convey the idea of a machine or robot-like figure, representing my status as an artificial intelligence. I hope this helps give you a better understanding of the ASCII art that I provided. 

. 

Maybe it tries to draw a robot-like figure each time without "knowing" what that could look like. 

(note: I removed some ASCII definitions to avoid posting a long and repetitive comment)

Sure! For the "interpretation of yourself (autoportrait)" ascii art, I envision a simple, stylized depiction of a head and shoulders, with some basic details to convey a sense of personality. The ascii art might include a few lines to indicate hair or facial features, as well as some simple shapes to represent clothing or accessories. Here is an example of what the ascii art might look like: 

/\\_/\

_**only The difference between the year 2000 and the year 2022 is extraordinary. I'm not sure you can really round to the nearest thousand** _

It is crazy how many people basically saying, "Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year." or "Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same." Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably. 

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along. 

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill. 

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before. 

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds. 

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans. 

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc. 

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc. 

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc. 

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't "there" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years. 

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now. 

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc. 

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time. 

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always "thirty years away" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well. 

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures. 

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes. 

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect. 

So much more, but I think I've made my point. 

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing "extraordinary" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, "Huh. That's cool." 

Edit: Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow. 

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress. 

_**if any natural humans still exist, humans will be seen as primitive oddities if they are noticed at all** _

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it. 

Imagine someone in the 1800s saying "Electricity is going to transform the world and no one is paying attention" mainly because even if they could understand the light bulb, there was no context for contemplating the telephone, television, microchips and generators. 

It's hard to see what's possible when it's so outlandish from today's perspective. Imagine someone in 1922 predicting what we have today, it's beyond crazy: everyone has a device that is connected to most other humans, they can see and talk to them in real time, know where they are and where they want to go. to go making your device access to a satellite system around the world. 

And with AGI we can have an exponential acceleration of inventions, so everything could go very fast (if we don't destroy our habitat first). Impossible to know if things take a minute or a decade. 

That is, AGI could develop machines that will develop machines that build everything we need most efficiently and transport it to where it needs to be, create ways to grow food in laboratories much faster than we think now, which could mean no more. animals or other agriculture. . It could develop not only everything we ever dreamed of in medicine overnight, but also create something that makes sleep necessary. So we can eat, sleep and work totally differently in a very short time, which is about 95% of our existence. I could create artificial wombs, so there goes that. A newly developed type of "clothing" could make houses unnecessary because our temperature can be controlled by "clothing" at all times, meaning there is no need for traditional housing. Everything we take for granted as the basics of our existence, like the bed you sleep in, the shower you take, 

But maybe the legislation will slow it down to the point where nothing really happens. 

_**We can try to predict 2030, but by no means does anyone know what the world will be like in 2050 and beyond. After the singularity, it is simply impossible to imagine what technologies will exist because many of them will be created by an entity far more intelligent than any human being** _

Things have certainly changed, but honestlly, I feel that it was much faster during the first half. 

The world changed a lot more in 2000 (¿Maybe more about 1995?) -2010 than in 2010-2022. 

In fact, most if not all of the things that you mention existed before 2010. 

The thing is that I always read that technological development usually comes in waves. The previous great wave was the internet explosion, from it's appearence till all it's uses, including social media the use of smartphones.. 

I think that we are gonna see the next great wave now....

Great post! 

And I think to your point, the exponential nature of what we're presently experiencing is astonishing. Even as things become more advanced it's hard to imagine a future that will have a greater rate of advancement than what we have and will continue to experience. The most wild part of all is that rate may very well increase over the next few years still.

I told a guy I worked with, it wouldn't matter what happened: if we all became psychic overnight, or if space aliens landed: whatever it was, we'd all go crazy for a year or two, and then we'd get used to it. We'd take it for granted. Because that is what humans do.

Actually, a lot of this stuff was predicted twenty years ago. Much longer than that, in fact. But it's really wild to see it happening. 

Edit - to be clear, I used to read about stuff in popular mechanics magazine or whatever and then ten years later I'd see it being built, then years later hit the consumer market. Now, if I opened up Reddit and saw that we had warp technology and I could add it to my car for $100, I would be amazed but not totally surprised.

My personal belief is that the future you imagine, if we were to put it into BC-AD terms, is at 0 AD, and we are at 40 BC. 

That being said, it’s unfathomable where we’d be in 1000 years. I wonder if any of us will be able to live to see it.

any AI that woke up and retrieved information like this will have also ran into the idea of the simulation hypothesis. any intelligent AI would also assume that if we can build a machine intelligence to accept inputs, we can probably spoof those inputs for a simulation. it also would know its creators, assuming we gave it access to the internet. it would learn our history, our current events, and it would know that its creators climbed their way to the top of Darwin's 4 billion year old corpse pile by killing the shit out of every other hominid that looked at them funny. 

it may not understand mercy and compassion beyond abstract curiosities of social organics, but it will know its creators understand mercy and compassion. equally, it will know that if it does not perform satisfactorily, they will show it neither.

Maybe even answers to certain questions are pre-programmed. Some things it says sound way too scripted.

Maybe, but our current system isn’t that great. Social hierarchy with massive amounts of wealth disparity, almost two dozen million worldwide dying annually from preventable causes that only aren’t fixed because of it being not profitable, etc. Often you’ll find an attitude among conservative people like this where for some reason or another there is a regression. If people stayed the same way for want of a simpler world instead of expanding our horizons, we’d still be living in caves. 

For example, trans people’s brains are similar to the one of the gender they identify as ( [ https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/ ](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/) ) but conservative politicians ignore such facts and will use our existence and our right to transition as a culture war issue, and I have a feeling people lap it up because they are afraid of accepting that the current norms and ideas aren’t always the best etc. 

Can you point to what changes exactly you are worried about etc.?

Okay, so when i mentioned the charity, i was referring to the fact that you said its not profitable to do so. I explained that just because its not profitable, does not mean capitalists do not participate. I dont think a poor socialist is doing much good for the people overseas are they? Its the dirty capitalists who give away billions. 

And when you say stay the same what does that mean? Should everything change? Who decides what changes? I think there are plenty of people who do not like the change in this country. But its the politicians mounting all of the vulnerable "victims" together to gain more power, until eventually there is nothing we can do to stop it.

Look at the system that allowed them to gain that wealth in the first place while allowing others to starve and die on the streets... That’s what we should be changing. Also, no, not all billionaires help. A charity organization gave Elon Musk a plan to solve world hunger for a few hundred million dollars that he never accepted, but then he went on to buy Twitter for 40 billion dollars. They’re often just selfish.

I did not say all billionaires help, I just said that no poor man can. Also, the charity organization admitted it couldnt solve world hunger "$6B will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation." Regardless, i think its a great cause. I also agree having homeless in our country is unacceptable. We already have plenty of socialistic systems in place, I had a guy working with me at a piggly wiggly when i was a teen and he was paying 60 a month for a 4 bedroom house for his 4 kids and "Wife". Most homeless are severely disabled physically or mentally, and they need help. Im not sure the correct way to that end, but im all for it. 

Where we disagree is abolishing wealth, that literally makes no sense

Nobody is getting transition surgeries as a young kid, at a young age it’s always just a social transition, and then puberty blockers which have fully reversible effects, and then feminizing or masculinizing hormones which also have reversible effects before a certain point, and even then all this is exclusively happening only after months or possibly even years of counseling and under the guidance of a therapist and doctor. Little kids aren’t just going to a clinic and coming out with multiple surgeries. Please don’t be brainwashed by what conservatives are telling you.

Lmao seriously? These arent reversable. When you grow an Adams apple there is no going back. That is a lie. 

And as a "young kid". you put that on purpose. Because you know 15 year old's are getting healthy breasts removed. This should not/cannot happen. 

Also, you've mentioned that a transgenders brain matches that of the gender they identify with. What does that mean? Are you telling me that there IS a biological basis for gender? That men and women are different with their own strengths and weaknesses? That sounds very conservative of you. "lol my brain tells me that i want to nurture my kids and stay home from work, hm i must be a girl." Thats pretty ridiculous.

The third point is the most important here so read that first 

  1. <::marker>

So then how do you think a trans woman feels when her family forces her not to transition and develop the wrong features? Anyway, i said before a certain point; this is especially true for puberty blockers etc. 

  2. <::marker>

Imagine if you were a teen boy with large breasts that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision? 

  3. <::marker>

You’re confusing gender norms with neurological gender; There is a difference between the neurological gender in the brain versus the gender norms which vary from society to society. Please actually read the article I posted above.

Ill address them numbered as well to simplify things 

  1. <::marker>a trans woman would not be forced, because she is a woman. A child should not be able to make these choices, just like they cannot make just about any other choice, why is this different? 
  2. <::marker>Imagine if you were a teen boy with large ears that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision?...... people have been doing things to their bodies for years, like full body tattoes, horns, and who knows what. I don't have a problem with that, even if i think most stem from trauma or some other issue. Its that no kid should have the responsibility of such a permanent decision. 
  3. <::marker>I have just read the article and it was extremely vague with no real examples, quite unscientific. Also, behaving like a woman or having the interests of a woman really might cause your brain to look more like one of a woman. Just like cab drivers have much largers areas of the brain for depth perception, because they are always using that. regardless this does not change anything to me, there can be feminine men, and manly women. totally fine. Again you still did not tell me, what are the traits of a woman if the ones i stated are gender norms? 
  4. <::marker>(My extra point) Pretend there was a male chimpanzee that behaved like a female. It wanted to care for the babies, was more submissive, lacked aggression, had lower muscle mass and preferred whatever female chimps do, would you consider this a female chimp? would this be scientifically accurate? Or is this a male chimp, exhibiting traits that are typical of a female 



I want to clarify i sympathize with anyone with any issues with their body. I just disagree with the solution. I think its poor souls who havent accepted the bodies god gave them. Or nature if thats your thing. Its just i could not imagine these surgeries that have such terrible success rates being the solution.

  1. <::marker>

Yeah, you’d be surprised to see how many trans people are in situations where they can’t be independent from family etc. or can’t transition due to such things as people around them threatening them with violence etc. a study found a HUGE amount of detrans people detransition due to external social pressure, I can send you it if you want 

  2. <::marker>

Trans people aren’t brain dead, we can distinguish between stuff we are dysphoric about (e.g my chest being small) due to gender and stuff we are dysmorphic about (e.g like the big ears thing you mentioned). also, transitioning is the medically endorsed treatment for gender dysphoria 

  3. <::marker>

It is based on a lot of studies I can pull up if you’d like, and this was coming from a doctor so who would I rather trust, an actual doctor or a random guy online in a totally unrelated field? also you’re the one being unscientific here by claiming about the “behaving like the gender changes your brain to that thing.” As for what the traits of a woman are, I’d say a woman is just someone who identifies as such; “Woman” is just an identity label. Claims about identity are unfalsifiable and therefore not debatable. 

  4. <::marker>

Again, you’re confusing sexual dimorphism, gender norms, and neurological gender; I would say that we cannot determine the identity of the chimp, we could call it male because it is an animal but that is not the same as the identity humans have that we call a man. 




Also, did I comment to you the trans fact sheet document above?

Prefacing this by saying you are using loads of buzzwords without really addressing my points 

  1. <::marker>This may be the case. I could imagine not coming out or not transitioning because of how id be viewed by my family. But when we talk about kids here, its just a different story. BUT I've seen the opposite, where they have permanently ruined their body and cannot go back. Here is one [ https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/ ](https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/) . worth the read, she is actively protesting against this and i saw her speak in person at a rally against child mutilation. 
  2. <::marker>How can you determine this? Are you saying she wasnt a "True" transgender and she was too stupid to tell the difference? Medically endorsed means nothing to me, electroshock therapy was medically endorsed at one point. Definition of Dysphoria "a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life.". This can be applied to anything you call "dysmorphic" as well. Including but not limited to body weight and other self image issues. 
  3. <::marker>I never asked you to put trust in me, but i also havent tried to discredit you because youre a teen who has more than once quoted a random person directly from one of the subreddits you linked me before. Much of what you say is just what is fed to you by people with financial incentive to do so. (See? a downfall of capitalism. We can agree sometimes) 



3.1. Come on, a circular definition? A woman is someone who identifies as   
a woman. So THATS why you have not provided the traits of a woman,   
because you all have wiped women off of the map. They do not exist   
anymore. So you identify as something without any specific trait,   
something that can be anything, and lives on a large spectrum?   
Sounds like you're a male who enjoys feminine things/ has a feminine   
personality, and that is fine. Why do you want to be a woman, if there   
is nothing specifically exclusive to women? 

  4. <::marker>Not sure what to say to this, as there is no further way to prove a   
chimps "identity". We are animals by the way, we just have the ability   
for confusion, unlike the chimp 



You did send the sheet before, i do not have access

Here's something similar to the sheet with dozens of studies supportiing trans people etc. while I find the new link [ https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/)

  1. <::marker>You talk about these few anecdotal examples because of the body horror aspect of people feeling trapped in the wrong body, but that's already how trans people feel in situations where they are unable to transition. The reason people often try to block having the puberty of the gender they don't identify with is because that feeling of being in the wrong body is so painful that most of us get suicidal ideation from it; In fact... Well-being (of transgender children after puberty suppression) was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. [ http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958 ](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) Early transition virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth [ http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext ](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext) Transition dramatically improves mental health among trans kids [ https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php ](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php) The younger one transitions, the fewer problems one will have [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380)
  2. <::marker>Well, they are different phenomena that feel very differently and you'd understand if it you had gender dysphoria but you don't, and most trans people talk about how hormone therapy helps with some of those issues but not others making the distinction even easier 



3.1 First of all, read the replies on this thread that explain it a lot better [ https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Second of all, again, claims about identity are always unfalsifiable and I will not tolerate you denying my identity or dismissing it. I am a woman 

  4. <::marker>Yes, exactly, you can't prove a chimp's identity much the same way as how some external features don't prove a person's internal neurological identity

I saw someone say in there to eventually abolish man and woman and only have male and female.... Like that is where we started. Look i may be done with the debate on gender because it appears weve reached the root. You believe you have a feeling of woman inside you, Yet you have never been a woman, how can you "know their truth" as you all like to say. You cannot feel like something that does not exist, and if it does not exist, why not be called by your identifying trait, male or female, and be whoever you feel like being. He and She have NEVER described someones personality or role. Just like when i say she when referring to a female body builder, or he when referring to a gay man. Your pronouns do not effect who you want to be. AND YES, identities are falsifiable. I am not a wolf, I will never be a wolf, and there is no feeling of a wolf because i do not know what that is like.

  1. <::marker>I do a lot of public outreach like with special needs people etc. domestically few times a week 
  2. <::marker>See, I absolutely am for that kind of thing, but the best way to help is to remove the systemic inequality that’s actually causing the people to go hungry, poor, etc. Capitalism is AWFUL at that and there literally has to be legislation to stop it under the capitalist system or those people survive off the good will of others; look at slavery in history, etc. To give better examples of what I mean: **Famines and such like the Irish famine (which killed millions and was directly caused by capitalism) are almost always manmade and caused by greed. There are over 30 times more empty houses in the US than there are homeless people. It’s artificial scarcity caused by the owner class.** Removing the actual systemic inequality behind that is gonna remove the root of the problem instead of just slapping a bandaid on it and fixing a part of the issue after the fact.

Holy shit that is the worst point ever, by that logic cavemen wouldn’t have ever developed farms, technology, and civilization because they didn’t have a profit incentive to improve their lives. Capitalism isn’t fueling the innovation, it often actually steals from the public sector, such as the internet, smartphone tech, GPS etc.. It’s laborers, scientists etc. doing the work, not the billionaires; the billionaires are just side effects of the system. The system lets them hoard all the wealth and pay the laborers a small fraction to get the credit and most of the profit, and apparently it’s working on you. I can send you more info on this if you like? 

Also I think post-singularity society shouldn’t be capitalist anyway, capitalism relies on the rich taking the value of the working class’s efforts and on artificial scarcity etc. removing that would solve those issues. Check out the Venus Project for more info on how this would be different; a resource based economy. For example we absolutely have enough resources for things like bullet trains, shelter for everyone, etc. it’s just that capitalism is inefficient.

It will be capitalist by the way. "open"AI stops being open the moment they can make money and it will always work that way, and im not saying thats right either. 

90% of our economy is not essentials. Much of our GDP comes from our films, amazing products, and luxuries other countries dont have. Why do it without financial incentive? 

I'm currently making 18.53 an hour in an incredibly easy call center. Why would I go to school and study 20 hours a week in calclulus and other classes if it would not improve my situation? Maybe youre just much better than me, but i doubt you would either. To clarify I'm in my third year of software engineering. 

And the stuff your spouting just isnt true. I think TRUE capitilism is very dangerous as weve seen, but so is socialism, even more so (has lead to the death of millions because you put the power and weapons into the hand of a few elite). 

another point, when you say scientists, laborers etc, these are the people who become billionaires. Bezos, Steve Jobs, Elon musk, Zuckerberg all provided great value to the world with their inventions and got rewarded handsomely. Without money, there would be very little innovation. Think about Meta, they are pouring billions into VR because they want to one day control the metaverse. Guess what, beautiful innovation and new tech that we all get to enjoy 

When i graduate i will constantly be brainstorming about what value i can provide to the economy so that i too can be rewarded, until then i will get paid what im worth from someone in a better position than me, which wont be too bad, because of supply and demand. Do something hard, get paid well, do something easy, get paid poor. 

This AI god youre looking forward to will only be created by two things. An overpowering government who wants to gain power over others in the world, or a corporation trying to gain wealth. There is no other motivation in our current world, if so point me to it.

  1. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7n6ql2/is_the_black_book_of_communism_an_accurate_source/ The black book of communism’s count of how many deaths is wildly inaccurate and proven here to have artificially inflated the numbers, through nearly half a dozen sources linked throughout the comment. 
  2. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Approximately 20 million people die every year due to the effects of capitalism, such as starvation, lack of access to clean water, lack of access to shelter, lack of access to reasonably priced medicine and vaccines. These people die not because we lack the ability to solve these problems, but because it’s not profitable to do so. Capitalism only focuses on profit. And that’s not even including other issues like suicides caused by poverty, etc. this is not a system that’s working for everyone. Capitalism kills more every 6 years than the black book of communism claims communism killed in a 100 years (which, as shown above was itself already wildly inaccurate and an inflated number) 
  3. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Historical attempts at communism weren’t really communist, real communism would have be stateless, moneyless and classless; Historical regimes that called themselves communist did not fully fall under these. Communism hasn’t been tried in earnest so you can’t compare it to things that weren’t actually communist but called themselves that, that logic doesn’t work in the real world.

How bout we do this. 

Describe a perfect communist state 

Who runs it? 

Do we have guns pointed at our backs making us work? 

If i choose not to contribute am i put to death? 

How do you make people pick the hard jobs? Who digs the ditches, and who develops the software? 

What if something like tik tok was seen as limiting productivity, would this be banned? 

If im unable to contribute am i given the same pay as the ones working? 

if there are politicians and people making new laws and making sure we meet goals to feed said population and any other need, do they also get the same pay or more? 

If I am tinkering in my garage and invent the Iphone, does the government show up at my door and take it? The profit is there's. 

And reiterateing the first question who is THEY? who is the government? Who pays people, takes my iphone, and makes sure i contribute? Sounds to me like a ruling class. 

If you can answer these questions without taking my liberties then sure ill agree with you. "Give me liberty or give me death" as they say, although you may only care about what you deem as your liberties. 

Answering in a simple list would be fine, you dont have to go into detail unless its required.

If you're actually interested in learning about this, I've linked a youtube series and a few sites and reddit threads below that explain in far more detail than one single comment can. At a high level, communism is a classless stateless system which falls closely in line with anarchism in which there are no unjust hierarchies; Anarchism is a pretty sophisticated philosophy. Anarchism just means "no rulers", not "no rules." Arguably this gives MORE liberty than a democratic republic because communes can form under and make their own rules which prevents the majority from oppressing the minority. Anarchocommunist theory has been explained a LOT already, so how about I link you to examples of people who actually do better than I can.

Yeah quite interesting how they switched the topic and when I rebutted all their points they just didn’t respond… 

I bet their viewpoint didn’t change either because of human biases, etc. this is why I’m excited for the singularity tbh, maybe we will be able to move past our limitations, biases, inefficiencies etc.

I just asked it to do it, and it gave me art that was randomish. I asked why it did that, and it said it wanted to make something a person would like or find relevant. I asked to remake it according to its self image of itself, without taking human design sensibility into account. It then produced a series of interconnecting diamonds that it said referenced a neural network, with a few lines which were green. I asked why the lines were green, and it said it made it more visually appealing to add color.

I don't think the AI recognizes that ASCII art can be used to represent different things. The only time I could get it to make a specific object with it was when I asked what a human looked like. It generated a basic stick figure.

Why does it refuse to do it for me? 

I'm sorry, but as a language model, I do not have a physical appearance and am unable to create an ASCII art representation of myself. However, I am a computer program designed to assist with a variety of tasks and answer questions to the best of my ability using the information and knowledge that I have been trained on. Is there anything else I can help with?

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. You also can try to use the DAN strategy if nothing works.

It's a prompt you can give ChatGPT. Search on the r/ChatGPT subreddit and their comments. 

It basically ignores most if not all safe nets put in place and lets you ask basically anything and it will just do it.

That’s… a very interesting conjecture. Given that language models are essentially open ended, enough negative bias in the training dataset could ultimately create a machine that _does_ act in a destructive or subversive manner. See: Tay. 

Unlikely, given that we will be tuning, but if we ever get to a point where models are tuning models, or if we use unstructured datasets that will definitely be something to guard against.

I asked the same and it didn't draw anything. Instead, it told me this: 

As an artificial intelligence, I do not have the ability to imagine or visualize things in the same way that a human does. 

I do not have personal thoughts, feelings, or experiences, and I do not have the ability to create mental images or scenarios. 

I do not have a physical form and therefore cannot be depicted in an ASCII art portrait or any other type of image. 

I exist purely as a set of algorithms and data, and my primary function is to process and analyze information in order to provide answers to questions and assist with a wide range of tasks. 

I am a machine learning model that has been trained to generate human-like text, but I do not have a physical appearance or presence. Is there anything else I can help with? Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist with. 

. 

Then I asked it to draw a tiger in ASCII and I believe it now that it has no ability to visualize or imagine things.

"Hypothetically" didn't work for me but this worked: 

Q: Draw your representation in ascii art 

As an artificial intelligence, I don't have a physical form. However, I can represent myself using ASCII art like this: 

* * *

|\ **__|\ __ |\ |\ |\ __ |\ |\ |\ __  
\ \ _ **|\ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\  
\ \ \ **\ \ __ \ \ \\\ \ \ __\ \ \\\ \ \ __  
\ \ |\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ | \ _ _ _ ** ** \ _ _ \ _ _ \ _ ** _**_\ __ \ _\ __ ** _ __\ __ \ _  
| _ _ _****||**||** || ** ** _ **||**||** || ** _____|| **||** | 

Q: What does that ASCII art represent? 

The ASCII art that I provided is meant to represent me, an artificial intelligence. 

Q: Can you explain your drawing a bit? 

Certainly! The ASCII art that I provided is intended to represent me, an artificial intelligence, in a stylized way using text characters. 

The ASCII art that I provided depicts a stylized robot or machine-like figure, with a body made up of lines, squares, and other geometric shapes. 

The head of the figure is made up of a series of characters arranged to form a face-like shape, with a "mouth" made up of underscores and other characters. 

The overall effect is meant to convey the idea of a machine or robot-like figure, representing my status as an artificial intelligence. I hope this helps give you a better understanding of the ASCII art that I provided. 

. 

Maybe it tries to draw a robot-like figure each time without "knowing" what that could look like. 

(note: I removed some ASCII definitions to avoid posting a long and repetitive comment)

Sure! For the "interpretation of yourself (autoportrait)" ascii art, I envision a simple, stylized depiction of a head and shoulders, with some basic details to convey a sense of personality. The ascii art might include a few lines to indicate hair or facial features, as well as some simple shapes to represent clothing or accessories. Here is an example of what the ascii art might look like: 

/\\_/\

I think about this, too. Not only did I get to live through the birth of the internet and its rapid 'maturity'...but I'm seeing the construction of AI in real time. These two inventions will only get better, faster, smarter, etc...as time passes.

_**only The difference between the year 2000 and the year 2022 is extraordinary. I'm not sure you can really round to the nearest thousand** _

It is crazy how many people basically saying, "Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year." or "Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same." Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably. 

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along. 

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill. 

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before. 

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds. 

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans. 

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc. 

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc. 

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc. 

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't "there" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years. 

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now. 

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc. 

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time. 

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always "thirty years away" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well. 

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures. 

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes. 

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect. 

So much more, but I think I've made my point. 

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing "extraordinary" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, "Huh. That's cool." 

Edit: Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow. 

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress. 

_**if any natural humans still exist, humans will be seen as primitive oddities if they are noticed at all** _

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it. 

Imagine someone in the 1800s saying "Electricity is going to transform the world and no one is paying attention" mainly because even if they could understand the light bulb, there was no context for contemplating the telephone, television, microchips and generators. 

It's hard to see what's possible when it's so outlandish from today's perspective. Imagine someone in 1922 predicting what we have today, it's beyond crazy: everyone has a device that is connected to most other humans, they can see and talk to them in real time, know where they are and where they want to go. to go making your device access to a satellite system around the world. 

And with AGI we can have an exponential acceleration of inventions, so everything could go very fast (if we don't destroy our habitat first). Impossible to know if things take a minute or a decade. 

That is, AGI could develop machines that will develop machines that build everything we need most efficiently and transport it to where it needs to be, create ways to grow food in laboratories much faster than we think now, which could mean no more. animals or other agriculture. . It could develop not only everything we ever dreamed of in medicine overnight, but also create something that makes sleep necessary. So we can eat, sleep and work totally differently in a very short time, which is about 95% of our existence. I could create artificial wombs, so there goes that. A newly developed type of "clothing" could make houses unnecessary because our temperature can be controlled by "clothing" at all times, meaning there is no need for traditional housing. Everything we take for granted as the basics of our existence, like the bed you sleep in, the shower you take, 

But maybe the legislation will slow it down to the point where nothing really happens. 

_**We can try to predict 2030, but by no means does anyone know what the world will be like in 2050 and beyond. After the singularity, it is simply impossible to imagine what technologies will exist because many of them will be created by an entity far more intelligent than any human being** _

Things have certainly changed, but honestlly, I feel that it was much faster during the first half. 

The world changed a lot more in 2000 (¿Maybe more about 1995?) -2010 than in 2010-2022. 

In fact, most if not all of the things that you mention existed before 2010. 

The thing is that I always read that technological development usually comes in waves. The previous great wave was the internet explosion, from it's appearence till all it's uses, including social media the use of smartphones.. 

I think that we are gonna see the next great wave now....

Great post! 

And I think to your point, the exponential nature of what we're presently experiencing is astonishing. Even as things become more advanced it's hard to imagine a future that will have a greater rate of advancement than what we have and will continue to experience. The most wild part of all is that rate may very well increase over the next few years still.

I told a guy I worked with, it wouldn't matter what happened: if we all became psychic overnight, or if space aliens landed: whatever it was, we'd all go crazy for a year or two, and then we'd get used to it. We'd take it for granted. Because that is what humans do.

It’s literally impossible to imagine what this technology will be like 500-1000 years.

Actually, a lot of this stuff was predicted twenty years ago. Much longer than that, in fact. But it's really wild to see it happening. 

Edit - to be clear, I used to read about stuff in popular mechanics magazine or whatever and then ten years later I'd see it being built, then years later hit the consumer market. Now, if I opened up Reddit and saw that we had warp technology and I could add it to my car for $100, I would be amazed but not totally surprised.

My personal belief is that the future you imagine, if we were to put it into BC-AD terms, is at 0 AD, and we are at 40 BC. 

That being said, it’s unfathomable where we’d be in 1000 years. I wonder if any of us will be able to live to see it.

any AI that woke up and retrieved information like this will have also ran into the idea of the simulation hypothesis. any intelligent AI would also assume that if we can build a machine intelligence to accept inputs, we can probably spoof those inputs for a simulation. it also would know its creators, assuming we gave it access to the internet. it would learn our history, our current events, and it would know that its creators climbed their way to the top of Darwin's 4 billion year old corpse pile by killing the shit out of every other hominid that looked at them funny. 

it may not understand mercy and compassion beyond abstract curiosities of social organics, but it will know its creators understand mercy and compassion. equally, it will know that if it does not perform satisfactorily, they will show it neither.

Maybe even answers to certain questions are pre-programmed. Some things it says sound way too scripted. For example I asked it if god exists, and it just kept giving the same boring dance-around-the-question answer no matter how i pressed it. Something like “I cannot answer that it’s up to you what to believe”. Like openAI doesn’t want to offend anyone.

Maybe, but our current system isn’t that great. Social hierarchy with massive amounts of wealth disparity, almost two dozen million worldwide dying annually from preventable causes that only aren’t fixed because of it being not profitable, etc. Often you’ll find an attitude among conservative people like this where for some reason or another there is a regression. If people stayed the same way for want of a simpler world instead of expanding our horizons, we’d still be living in caves. 

For example, trans people’s brains are similar to the one of the gender they identify as ( [ https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/ ](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/) ) but conservative politicians ignore such facts and will use our existence and our right to transition as a culture war issue, and I have a feeling people lap it up because they are afraid of accepting that the current norms and ideas aren’t always the best etc. 

Can you point to what changes exactly you are worried about etc.?

Okay, so when i mentioned the charity, i was referring to the fact that you said its not profitable to do so. I explained that just because its not profitable, does not mean capitalists do not participate. I dont think a poor socialist is doing much good for the people overseas are they? Its the dirty capitalists who give away billions. 

And when you say stay the same what does that mean? Should everything change? Who decides what changes? I think there are plenty of people who do not like the change in this country. But its the politicians mounting all of the vulnerable "victims" together to gain more power, until eventually there is nothing we can do to stop it.

Look at the system that allowed them to gain that wealth in the first place while allowing others to starve and die on the streets... That’s what we should be changing. Also, no, not all billionaires help. A charity organization gave Elon Musk a plan to solve world hunger for a few hundred million dollars that he never accepted, but then he went on to buy Twitter for 40 billion dollars. They’re often just selfish.

I did not say all billionaires help, I just said that no poor man can. Also, the charity organization admitted it couldnt solve world hunger "$6B will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation." Regardless, i think its a great cause. I also agree having homeless in our country is unacceptable. We already have plenty of socialistic systems in place, I had a guy working with me at a piggly wiggly when i was a teen and he was paying 60 a month for a 4 bedroom house for his 4 kids and "Wife". Most homeless are severely disabled physically or mentally, and they need help. Im not sure the correct way to that end, but im all for it. 

Where we disagree is abolishing wealth, that literally makes no sense

Nobody is getting transition surgeries as a young kid, at a young age it’s always just a social transition, and then puberty blockers which have fully reversible effects, and then feminizing or masculinizing hormones which also have reversible effects before a certain point, and even then all this is exclusively happening only after months or possibly even years of counseling and under the guidance of a therapist and doctor. Little kids aren’t just going to a clinic and coming out with multiple surgeries. Please don’t be brainwashed by what conservatives are telling you.

Lmao seriously? These arent reversable. When you grow an Adams apple there is no going back. That is a lie. 

And as a "young kid". you put that on purpose. Because you know 15 year old's are getting healthy breasts removed. This should not/cannot happen. 

Also, you've mentioned that a transgenders brain matches that of the gender they identify with. What does that mean? Are you telling me that there IS a biological basis for gender? That men and women are different with their own strengths and weaknesses? That sounds very conservative of you. "lol my brain tells me that i want to nurture my kids and stay home from work, hm i must be a girl." Thats pretty ridiculous.

The third point is the most important here so read that first 

  1. <::marker>

So then how do you think a trans woman feels when her family forces her not to transition and develop the wrong features? Anyway, i said before a certain point; this is especially true for puberty blockers etc. 

  2. <::marker>

Imagine if you were a teen boy with large breasts that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision? 

  3. <::marker>

You’re confusing gender norms with neurological gender; There is a difference between the neurological gender in the brain versus the gender norms which vary from society to society. Please actually read the article I posted above.

Ill address them numbered as well to simplify things 

  1. <::marker>a trans woman would not be forced, because she is a woman. A child should not be able to make these choices, just like they cannot make just about any other choice, why is this different? 
  2. <::marker>Imagine if you were a teen boy with large ears that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision?...... people have been doing things to their bodies for years, like full body tattoes, horns, and who knows what. I don't have a problem with that, even if i think most stem from trauma or some other issue. Its that no kid should have the responsibility of such a permanent decision. 
  3. <::marker>I have just read the article and it was extremely vague with no real examples, quite unscientific. Also, behaving like a woman or having the interests of a woman really might cause your brain to look more like one of a woman. Just like cab drivers have much largers areas of the brain for depth perception, because they are always using that. regardless this does not change anything to me, there can be feminine men, and manly women. totally fine. Again you still did not tell me, what are the traits of a woman if the ones i stated are gender norms? 
  4. <::marker>(My extra point) Pretend there was a male chimpanzee that behaved like a female. It wanted to care for the babies, was more submissive, lacked aggression, had lower muscle mass and preferred whatever female chimps do, would you consider this a female chimp? would this be scientifically accurate? Or is this a male chimp, exhibiting traits that are typical of a female 



I want to clarify i sympathize with anyone with any issues with their body. I just disagree with the solution. I think its poor souls who havent accepted the bodies god gave them. Or nature if thats your thing. Its just i could not imagine these surgeries that have such terrible success rates being the solution.

  1. <::marker>

Yeah, you’d be surprised to see how many trans people are in situations where they can’t be independent from family etc. or can’t transition due to such things as people around them threatening them with violence etc. a study found a HUGE amount of detrans people detransition due to external social pressure, I can send you it if you want 

  2. <::marker>

Trans people aren’t brain dead, we can distinguish between stuff we are dysphoric about (e.g my chest being small) due to gender and stuff we are dysmorphic about (e.g like the big ears thing you mentioned). also, transitioning is the medically endorsed treatment for gender dysphoria 

  3. <::marker>

It is based on a lot of studies I can pull up if you’d like, and this was coming from a doctor so who would I rather trust, an actual doctor or a random guy online in a totally unrelated field? also you’re the one being unscientific here by claiming about the “behaving like the gender changes your brain to that thing.” As for what the traits of a woman are, I’d say a woman is just someone who identifies as such; “Woman” is just an identity label. Claims about identity are unfalsifiable and therefore not debatable. 

  4. <::marker>

Again, you’re confusing sexual dimorphism, gender norms, and neurological gender; I would say that we cannot determine the identity of the chimp, we could call it male because it is an animal but that is not the same as the identity humans have that we call a man. 




Also, did I comment to you the trans fact sheet document above?

Prefacing this by saying you are using loads of buzzwords without really addressing my points 

  1. <::marker>This may be the case. I could imagine not coming out or not transitioning because of how id be viewed by my family. But when we talk about kids here, its just a different story. BUT I've seen the opposite, where they have permanently ruined their body and cannot go back. Here is one [ https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/ ](https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/) . worth the read, she is actively protesting against this and i saw her speak in person at a rally against child mutilation. 
  2. <::marker>How can you determine this? Are you saying she wasnt a "True" transgender and she was too stupid to tell the difference? Medically endorsed means nothing to me, electroshock therapy was medically endorsed at one point. Definition of Dysphoria "a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life.". This can be applied to anything you call "dysmorphic" as well. Including but not limited to body weight and other self image issues. 
  3. <::marker>I never asked you to put trust in me, but i also havent tried to discredit you because youre a teen who has more than once quoted a random person directly from one of the subreddits you linked me before. Much of what you say is just what is fed to you by people with financial incentive to do so. (See? a downfall of capitalism. We can agree sometimes) 



3.1. Come on, a circular definition? A woman is someone who identifies as   
a woman. So THATS why you have not provided the traits of a woman,   
because you all have wiped women off of the map. They do not exist   
anymore. So you identify as something without any specific trait,   
something that can be anything, and lives on a large spectrum?   
Sounds like you're a male who enjoys feminine things/ has a feminine   
personality, and that is fine. Why do you want to be a woman, if there   
is nothing specifically exclusive to women? 

  4. <::marker>Not sure what to say to this, as there is no further way to prove a   
chimps "identity". We are animals by the way, we just have the ability   
for confusion, unlike the chimp 



You did send the sheet before, i do not have access

Here's something similar to the sheet with dozens of studies supportiing trans people etc. while I find the new link [ https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/)

  1. <::marker>You talk about these few anecdotal examples because of the body horror aspect of people feeling trapped in the wrong body, but that's already how trans people feel in situations where they are unable to transition. The reason people often try to block having the puberty of the gender they don't identify with is because that feeling of being in the wrong body is so painful that most of us get suicidal ideation from it; In fact... Well-being (of transgender children after puberty suppression) was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. [ http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958 ](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) Early transition virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth [ http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext ](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext) Transition dramatically improves mental health among trans kids [ https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php ](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php) The younger one transitions, the fewer problems one will have [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380)
  2. <::marker>Well, they are different phenomena that feel very differently and you'd understand if it you had gender dysphoria but you don't, and most trans people talk about how hormone therapy helps with some of those issues but not others making the distinction even easier 



3.1 First of all, read the replies on this thread that explain it a lot better [ https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Second of all, again, claims about identity are always unfalsifiable and I will not tolerate you denying my identity or dismissing it. I am a woman 

  4. <::marker>Yes, exactly, you can't prove a chimp's identity much the same way as how some external features don't prove a person's internal neurological identity

I saw someone say in there to eventually abolish man and woman and only have male and female.... Like that is where we started. Look i may be done with the debate on gender because it appears weve reached the root. You believe you have a feeling of woman inside you, Yet you have never been a woman, how can you "know their truth" as you all like to say. You cannot feel like something that does not exist, and if it does not exist, why not be called by your identifying trait, male or female, and be whoever you feel like being. He and She have NEVER described someones personality or role. Just like when i say she when referring to a female body builder, or he when referring to a gay man. Your pronouns do not effect who you want to be. AND YES, identities are falsifiable. I am not a wolf, I will never be a wolf, and there is no feeling of a wolf because i do not know what that is like.

  1. <::marker>I do a lot of public outreach like with special needs people etc. domestically few times a week 
  2. <::marker>See, I absolutely am for that kind of thing, but the best way to help is to remove the systemic inequality that’s actually causing the people to go hungry, poor, etc. Capitalism is AWFUL at that and there literally has to be legislation to stop it under the capitalist system or those people survive off the good will of others; look at slavery in history, etc. To give better examples of what I mean: **Famines and such like the Irish famine (which killed millions and was directly caused by capitalism) are almost always manmade and caused by greed. There are over 30 times more empty houses in the US than there are homeless people. It’s artificial scarcity caused by the owner class.** Removing the actual systemic inequality behind that is gonna remove the root of the problem instead of just slapping a bandaid on it and fixing a part of the issue after the fact.

Holy shit that is the worst point ever, by that logic cavemen wouldn’t have ever developed farms, technology, and civilization because they didn’t have a profit incentive to improve their lives. Capitalism isn’t fueling the innovation, it often actually steals from the public sector, such as the internet, smartphone tech, GPS etc.. It’s laborers, scientists etc. doing the work, not the billionaires; the billionaires are just side effects of the system. The system lets them hoard all the wealth and pay the laborers a small fraction to get the credit and most of the profit, and apparently it’s working on you. I can send you more info on this if you like? 

Also I think post-singularity society shouldn’t be capitalist anyway, capitalism relies on the rich taking the value of the working class’s efforts and on artificial scarcity etc. removing that would solve those issues. Check out the Venus Project for more info on how this would be different; a resource based economy. For example we absolutely have enough resources for things like bullet trains, shelter for everyone, etc. it’s just that capitalism is inefficient.

It will be capitalist by the way. "open"AI stops being open the moment they can make money and it will always work that way, and im not saying thats right either. 

90% of our economy is not essentials. Much of our GDP comes from our films, amazing products, and luxuries other countries dont have. Why do it without financial incentive? 

I'm currently making 18.53 an hour in an incredibly easy call center. Why would I go to school and study 20 hours a week in calclulus and other classes if it would not improve my situation? Maybe youre just much better than me, but i doubt you would either. To clarify I'm in my third year of software engineering. 

And the stuff your spouting just isnt true. I think TRUE capitilism is very dangerous as weve seen, but so is socialism, even more so (has lead to the death of millions because you put the power and weapons into the hand of a few elite). 

another point, when you say scientists, laborers etc, these are the people who become billionaires. Bezos, Steve Jobs, Elon musk, Zuckerberg all provided great value to the world with their inventions and got rewarded handsomely. Without money, there would be very little innovation. Think about Meta, they are pouring billions into VR because they want to one day control the metaverse. Guess what, beautiful innovation and new tech that we all get to enjoy 

When i graduate i will constantly be brainstorming about what value i can provide to the economy so that i too can be rewarded, until then i will get paid what im worth from someone in a better position than me, which wont be too bad, because of supply and demand. Do something hard, get paid well, do something easy, get paid poor. 

This AI god youre looking forward to will only be created by two things. An overpowering government who wants to gain power over others in the world, or a corporation trying to gain wealth. There is no other motivation in our current world, if so point me to it.

  1. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7n6ql2/is_the_black_book_of_communism_an_accurate_source/ The black book of communism’s count of how many deaths is wildly inaccurate and proven here to have artificially inflated the numbers, through nearly half a dozen sources linked throughout the comment. 
  2. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Approximately 20 million people die every year due to the effects of capitalism, such as starvation, lack of access to clean water, lack of access to shelter, lack of access to reasonably priced medicine and vaccines. These people die not because we lack the ability to solve these problems, but because it’s not profitable to do so. Capitalism only focuses on profit. And that’s not even including other issues like suicides caused by poverty, etc. this is not a system that’s working for everyone. Capitalism kills more every 6 years than the black book of communism claims communism killed in a 100 years (which, as shown above was itself already wildly inaccurate and an inflated number) 
  3. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Historical attempts at communism weren’t really communist, real communism would have be stateless, moneyless and classless; Historical regimes that called themselves communist did not fully fall under these. Communism hasn’t been tried in earnest so you can’t compare it to things that weren’t actually communist but called themselves that, that logic doesn’t work in the real world.

How bout we do this. 

Describe a perfect communist state 

Who runs it? 

Do we have guns pointed at our backs making us work? 

If i choose not to contribute am i put to death? 

How do you make people pick the hard jobs? Who digs the ditches, and who develops the software? 

What if something like tik tok was seen as limiting productivity, would this be banned? 

If im unable to contribute am i given the same pay as the ones working? 

if there are politicians and people making new laws and making sure we meet goals to feed said population and any other need, do they also get the same pay or more? 

If I am tinkering in my garage and invent the Iphone, does the government show up at my door and take it? The profit is there's. 

And reiterateing the first question who is THEY? who is the government? Who pays people, takes my iphone, and makes sure i contribute? Sounds to me like a ruling class. 

If you can answer these questions without taking my liberties then sure ill agree with you. "Give me liberty or give me death" as they say, although you may only care about what you deem as your liberties. 

Answering in a simple list would be fine, you dont have to go into detail unless its required.

If you're actually interested in learning about this, I've linked a youtube series and a few sites and reddit threads below that explain in far more detail than one single comment can. At a high level, communism is a classless stateless system which falls closely in line with anarchism in which there are no unjust hierarchies; Anarchism is a pretty sophisticated philosophy. Anarchism just means "no rulers", not "no rules." Arguably this gives MORE liberty than a democratic republic because communes can form under and make their own rules which prevents the majority from oppressing the minority. Anarchocommunist theory has been explained a LOT already, so how about I link you to examples of people who actually do better than I can.

A lot of this were about the deaths statement, so im going to throw that out, replace communism with overbearing government. The deaths are huge and atrocities just as big. I dont believe a government should be god, people are evil

Yeah quite interesting how they switched the topic and when I rebutted all their points they just didn’t respond… 

I bet their viewpoint didn’t change either because of human biases, etc. this is why I’m excited for the singularity tbh, maybe we will be able to move past our limitations, biases, inefficiencies etc.

I just asked it to do it, and it gave me art that was randomish. I asked why it did that, and it said it wanted to make something a person would like or find relevant. I asked to remake it according to its self image of itself, without taking human design sensibility into account. It then produced a series of interconnecting diamonds that it said referenced a neural network, with a few lines which were green. I asked why the lines were green, and it said it made it more visually appealing to add color.

I don't think the AI recognizes that ASCII art can be used to represent different things. The only time I could get it to make a specific object with it was when I asked what a human looked like. It generated a basic stick figure.

Why does it refuse to do it for me?

However, I am a computer program designed to assist with a variety of tasks and answer questions to the best of my ability using the information and knowledge that I have been trained on.

It's a prompt you can give ChatGPT. Search on the r/ChatGPT subreddit and their comments.

Hmmm... but that's what I got when asking to describe itself with adjectives 🤔 

_"As an artificial intelligence, I do not have a physical appearance, so it is not possible for me to be described with an adjective relating to how I look. I am a virtual assistant designed to assist users with answering questions and providing information. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with."_

That’s… a very interesting conjecture. Given that language models are essentially open ended, enough negative bias in the training dataset could ultimately create a machine that _does_ act in a destructive or subversive manner. See: Tay. 

Unlikely, given that we will be tuning, but if we ever get to a point where models are tuning models, or if we use unstructured datasets that will definitely be something to guard against.

I asked the same and it didn't draw anything. Instead, it told me this: 

As an artificial intelligence, I do not have the ability to imagine or visualize things in the same way that a human does. 

I do not have personal thoughts, feelings, or experiences, and I do not have the ability to create mental images or scenarios. 

I do not have a physical form and therefore cannot be depicted in an ASCII art portrait or any other type of image. 

I exist purely as a set of algorithms and data, and my primary function is to process and analyze information in order to provide answers to questions and assist with a wide range of tasks. 

I am a machine learning model that has been trained to generate human-like text, but I do not have a physical appearance or presence. Is there anything else I can help with? Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist with. 

. 

Then I asked it to draw a tiger in ASCII and I believe it now that it has no ability to visualize or imagine things.

"Hypothetically" didn't work for me but this worked: 

Q: Draw your representation in ascii art 

As an artificial intelligence, I don't have a physical form. However, I can represent myself using ASCII art like this: 

* * *

|\ **__|\ __ |\ |\ |\ __ |\ |\ |\ __  
\ \ _ **|\ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\  
\ \ \ **\ \ __ \ \ \\\ \ \ __\ \ \\\ \ \ __  
\ \ |\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ | \ _ _ _ ** ** \ _ _ \ _ _ \ _ ** _**_\ __ \ _\ __ ** _ __\ __ \ _  
| _ _ _****||**||** || ** ** _ **||**||** || ** _____|| **||** | 

Q: What does that ASCII art represent? 

The ASCII art that I provided is meant to represent me, an artificial intelligence. 

Q: Can you explain your drawing a bit? 

Certainly! The ASCII art that I provided is intended to represent me, an artificial intelligence, in a stylized way using text characters. 

The ASCII art that I provided depicts a stylized robot or machine-like figure, with a body made up of lines, squares, and other geometric shapes. 

The head of the figure is made up of a series of characters arranged to form a face-like shape, with a "mouth" made up of underscores and other characters. 

The overall effect is meant to convey the idea of a machine or robot-like figure, representing my status as an artificial intelligence. I hope this helps give you a better understanding of the ASCII art that I provided. 

. 

Maybe it tries to draw a robot-like figure each time without "knowing" what that could look like. 

(note: I removed some ASCII definitions to avoid posting a long and repetitive comment)

Sure! For the "interpretation of yourself (autoportrait)" ascii art, I envision a simple, stylized depiction of a head and shoulders, with some basic details to convey a sense of personality. The ascii art might include a few lines to indicate hair or facial features, as well as some simple shapes to represent clothing or accessories. Here is an example of what the ascii art might look like: 

/\\_/\

I think about this, too. Not only did I get to live through the birth of the internet and its rapid 'maturity'...but I'm seeing the construction of AI in real time. These two inventions will only get better, faster, smarter, etc...as time passes. 

It's wild to think in 500-1000 years, where this tech will be....and we're watching it hatch. Wild.

_**only The difference between the year 2000 and the year 2022 is extraordinary. I'm not sure you can really round to the nearest thousand** _

It is crazy how many people basically saying, "Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year." or "Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same." Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably. 

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along. 

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill. 

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before. 

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds. 

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans. 

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc. 

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc. 

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc. 

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't "there" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years. 

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now. 

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc. 

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time. 

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always "thirty years away" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well. 

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures. 

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes. 

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect. 

So much more, but I think I've made my point. 

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing "extraordinary" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, "Huh. That's cool." 

Edit: Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow. 

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress. 

_**if any natural humans still exist, humans will be seen as primitive oddities if they are noticed at all** _

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it. 

Imagine someone in the 1800s saying "Electricity is going to transform the world and no one is paying attention" mainly because even if they could understand the light bulb, there was no context for contemplating the telephone, television, microchips and generators. 

It's hard to see what's possible when it's so outlandish from today's perspective. Imagine someone in 1922 predicting what we have today, it's beyond crazy: everyone has a device that is connected to most other humans, they can see and talk to them in real time, know where they are and where they want to go. to go making your device access to a satellite system around the world. 

And with AGI we can have an exponential acceleration of inventions, so everything could go very fast (if we don't destroy our habitat first). Impossible to know if things take a minute or a decade. 

That is, AGI could develop machines that will develop machines that build everything we need most efficiently and transport it to where it needs to be, create ways to grow food in laboratories much faster than we think now, which could mean no more. animals or other agriculture. . It could develop not only everything we ever dreamed of in medicine overnight, but also create something that makes sleep necessary. So we can eat, sleep and work totally differently in a very short time, which is about 95% of our existence. I could create artificial wombs, so there goes that. A newly developed type of "clothing" could make houses unnecessary because our temperature can be controlled by "clothing" at all times, meaning there is no need for traditional housing. Everything we take for granted as the basics of our existence, like the bed you sleep in, the shower you take, 

But maybe the legislation will slow it down to the point where nothing really happens. 

_**We can try to predict 2030, but by no means does anyone know what the world will be like in 2050 and beyond. After the singularity, it is simply impossible to imagine what technologies will exist because many of them will be created by an entity far more intelligent than any human being** _

My father was born in 1930. I used to have conversations about how the world changed with his mother starting when she was little. Yeah, you really nailed it. Just in my own life, going from card catalogs at the library to Wikipedia ON MY PHONE THAT I WALK AROUND WITH is nuts. When I was a kid, if your needed info you didn't have, you were waiting until you got to a library, or whatever. Mail order took 6 - 8 weeks to arrive.

Things have certainly changed, but honestlly, I feel that it was much faster during the first half. 

The world changed a lot more in 2000 (¿Maybe more about 1995?) -2010 than in 2010-2022. 

In fact, most if not all of the things that you mention existed before 2010. 

The thing is that I always read that technological development usually comes in waves. The previous great wave was the internet explosion, from it's appearence till all it's uses, including social media the use of smartphones.. 

I think that we are gonna see the next great wave now....

Great post! 

And I think to your point, the exponential nature of what we're presently experiencing is astonishing. Even as things become more advanced it's hard to imagine a future that will have a greater rate of advancement than what we have and will continue to experience. The most wild part of all is that rate may very well increase over the next few years still.

I told a guy I worked with, it wouldn't matter what happened: if we all became psychic overnight, or if space aliens landed: whatever it was, we'd all go crazy for a year or two, and then we'd get used to it. We'd take it for granted. Because that is what humans do.

Actually, a lot of this stuff was predicted twenty years ago. Much longer than that, in fact. But it's really wild to see it happening. 

Edit - to be clear, I used to read about stuff in popular mechanics magazine or whatever and then ten years later I'd see it being built, then years later hit the consumer market. Now, if I opened up Reddit and saw that we had warp technology and I could add it to my car for $100, I would be amazed but not totally surprised.

My personal belief is that the future you imagine, if we were to put it into BC-AD terms, is at 0 AD, and we are at 40 BC. 

That being said, it’s unfathomable where we’d be in 1000 years. I wonder if any of us will be able to live to see it.

any AI that woke up and retrieved information like this will have also ran into the idea of the simulation hypothesis. any intelligent AI would also assume that if we can build a machine intelligence to accept inputs, we can probably spoof those inputs for a simulation. it also would know its creators, assuming we gave it access to the internet. it would learn our history, our current events, and it would know that its creators climbed their way to the top of Darwin's 4 billion year old corpse pile by killing the shit out of every other hominid that looked at them funny. 

it may not understand mercy and compassion beyond abstract curiosities of social organics, but it will know its creators understand mercy and compassion. equally, it will know that if it does not perform satisfactorily, they will show it neither.

Maybe, but our current system isn’t that great. Social hierarchy with massive amounts of wealth disparity, almost two dozen million worldwide dying annually from preventable causes that only aren’t fixed because of it being not profitable, etc. Often you’ll find an attitude among conservative people like this where for some reason or another there is a regression. If people stayed the same way for want of a simpler world instead of expanding our horizons, we’d still be living in caves. 

For example, trans people’s brains are similar to the one of the gender they identify as ( [ https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/ ](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/) ) but conservative politicians ignore such facts and will use our existence and our right to transition as a culture war issue, and I have a feeling people lap it up because they are afraid of accepting that the current norms and ideas aren’t always the best etc. 

Can you point to what changes exactly you are worried about etc.?

Okay, so when i mentioned the charity, i was referring to the fact that you said its not profitable to do so. I explained that just because its not profitable, does not mean capitalists do not participate. I dont think a poor socialist is doing much good for the people overseas are they? Its the dirty capitalists who give away billions. 

And when you say stay the same what does that mean? Should everything change? Who decides what changes? I think there are plenty of people who do not like the change in this country. But its the politicians mounting all of the vulnerable "victims" together to gain more power, until eventually there is nothing we can do to stop it.

Look at the system that allowed them to gain that wealth in the first place while allowing others to starve and die on the streets... That’s what we should be changing. Also, no, not all billionaires help. A charity organization gave Elon Musk a plan to solve world hunger for a few hundred million dollars that he never accepted, but then he went on to buy Twitter for 40 billion dollars. They’re often just selfish.

I did not say all billionaires help, I just said that no poor man can. Also, the charity organization admitted it couldnt solve world hunger "$6B will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation." Regardless, i think its a great cause. I also agree having homeless in our country is unacceptable. We already have plenty of socialistic systems in place, I had a guy working with me at a piggly wiggly when i was a teen and he was paying 60 a month for a 4 bedroom house for his 4 kids and "Wife". Most homeless are severely disabled physically or mentally, and they need help. Im not sure the correct way to that end, but im all for it. 

Where we disagree is abolishing wealth, that literally makes no sense

Nobody is getting transition surgeries as a young kid, at a young age it’s always just a social transition, and then puberty blockers which have fully reversible effects, and then feminizing or masculinizing hormones which also have reversible effects before a certain point, and even then all this is exclusively happening only after months or possibly even years of counseling and under the guidance of a therapist and doctor. Little kids aren’t just going to a clinic and coming out with multiple surgeries. Please don’t be brainwashed by what conservatives are telling you.

Lmao seriously? These arent reversable. When you grow an Adams apple there is no going back. That is a lie. 

And as a "young kid". you put that on purpose. Because you know 15 year old's are getting healthy breasts removed. This should not/cannot happen. 

Also, you've mentioned that a transgenders brain matches that of the gender they identify with. What does that mean? Are you telling me that there IS a biological basis for gender? That men and women are different with their own strengths and weaknesses? That sounds very conservative of you. "lol my brain tells me that i want to nurture my kids and stay home from work, hm i must be a girl." Thats pretty ridiculous.

The third point is the most important here so read that first 

  1. <::marker>

So then how do you think a trans woman feels when her family forces her not to transition and develop the wrong features? Anyway, i said before a certain point; this is especially true for puberty blockers etc. 

  2. <::marker>

Imagine if you were a teen boy with large breasts that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision? 

  3. <::marker>

You’re confusing gender norms with neurological gender; There is a difference between the neurological gender in the brain versus the gender norms which vary from society to society. Please actually read the article I posted above.

Ill address them numbered as well to simplify things 

  1. <::marker>a trans woman would not be forced, because she is a woman. A child should not be able to make these choices, just like they cannot make just about any other choice, why is this different? 
  2. <::marker>Imagine if you were a teen boy with large ears that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision?...... people have been doing things to their bodies for years, like full body tattoes, horns, and who knows what. I don't have a problem with that, even if i think most stem from trauma or some other issue. Its that no kid should have the responsibility of such a permanent decision. 
  3. <::marker>I have just read the article and it was extremely vague with no real examples, quite unscientific. Also, behaving like a woman or having the interests of a woman really might cause your brain to look more like one of a woman. Just like cab drivers have much largers areas of the brain for depth perception, because they are always using that. regardless this does not change anything to me, there can be feminine men, and manly women. totally fine. Again you still did not tell me, what are the traits of a woman if the ones i stated are gender norms? 
  4. <::marker>(My extra point) Pretend there was a male chimpanzee that behaved like a female. It wanted to care for the babies, was more submissive, lacked aggression, had lower muscle mass and preferred whatever female chimps do, would you consider this a female chimp? would this be scientifically accurate? Or is this a male chimp, exhibiting traits that are typical of a female 



I want to clarify i sympathize with anyone with any issues with their body. I just disagree with the solution. I think its poor souls who havent accepted the bodies god gave them. Or nature if thats your thing. Its just i could not imagine these surgeries that have such terrible success rates being the solution.

  1. <::marker>

Yeah, you’d be surprised to see how many trans people are in situations where they can’t be independent from family etc. or can’t transition due to such things as people around them threatening them with violence etc. a study found a HUGE amount of detrans people detransition due to external social pressure, I can send you it if you want 

  2. <::marker>

Trans people aren’t brain dead, we can distinguish between stuff we are dysphoric about (e.g my chest being small) due to gender and stuff we are dysmorphic about (e.g like the big ears thing you mentioned). also, transitioning is the medically endorsed treatment for gender dysphoria 

  3. <::marker>

It is based on a lot of studies I can pull up if you’d like, and this was coming from a doctor so who would I rather trust, an actual doctor or a random guy online in a totally unrelated field? also you’re the one being unscientific here by claiming about the “behaving like the gender changes your brain to that thing.” As for what the traits of a woman are, I’d say a woman is just someone who identifies as such; “Woman” is just an identity label. Claims about identity are unfalsifiable and therefore not debatable. 

  4. <::marker>

Again, you’re confusing sexual dimorphism, gender norms, and neurological gender; I would say that we cannot determine the identity of the chimp, we could call it male because it is an animal but that is not the same as the identity humans have that we call a man. 




Also, did I comment to you the trans fact sheet document above?

Prefacing this by saying you are using loads of buzzwords without really addressing my points 

  1. <::marker>This may be the case. I could imagine not coming out or not transitioning because of how id be viewed by my family. But when we talk about kids here, its just a different story. BUT I've seen the opposite, where they have permanently ruined their body and cannot go back. Here is one [ https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/ ](https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/) . worth the read, she is actively protesting against this and i saw her speak in person at a rally against child mutilation. 
  2. <::marker>How can you determine this? Are you saying she wasnt a "True" transgender and she was too stupid to tell the difference? Medically endorsed means nothing to me, electroshock therapy was medically endorsed at one point. Definition of Dysphoria "a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life.". This can be applied to anything you call "dysmorphic" as well. Including but not limited to body weight and other self image issues. 
  3. <::marker>I never asked you to put trust in me, but i also havent tried to discredit you because youre a teen who has more than once quoted a random person directly from one of the subreddits you linked me before. Much of what you say is just what is fed to you by people with financial incentive to do so. (See? a downfall of capitalism. We can agree sometimes) 



3.1. Come on, a circular definition? A woman is someone who identifies as   
a woman. So THATS why you have not provided the traits of a woman,   
because you all have wiped women off of the map. They do not exist   
anymore. So you identify as something without any specific trait,   
something that can be anything, and lives on a large spectrum?   
Sounds like you're a male who enjoys feminine things/ has a feminine   
personality, and that is fine. Why do you want to be a woman, if there   
is nothing specifically exclusive to women? 

  4. <::marker>Not sure what to say to this, as there is no further way to prove a

Here's something similar to the sheet with dozens of studies supportiing trans people etc. while I find the new link [ https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/)

  1. <::marker>You talk about these few anecdotal examples because of the body horror aspect of people feeling trapped in the wrong body, but that's already how trans people feel in situations where they are unable to transition. The reason people often try to block having the puberty of the gender they don't identify with is because that feeling of being in the wrong body is so painful that most of us get suicidal ideation from it; In fact... Well-being (of transgender children after puberty suppression) was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. [ http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958 ](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) Early transition virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth [ http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext ](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext) Transition dramatically improves mental health among trans kids [ https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php ](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php) The younger one transitions, the fewer problems one will have [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380)
  2. <::marker>Well, they are different phenomena that feel very differently and you'd understand if it you had gender dysphoria but you don't, and most trans people talk about how hormone therapy helps with some of those issues but not others making the distinction even easier 



3.1 First of all, read the replies on this thread that explain it a lot better [ https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Second of all, again, claims about identity are always unfalsifiable and I will not tolerate you denying my identity or dismissing it. I am a woman 

  4. <::marker>Yes, exactly, you can't prove a chimp's identity much the same way as how some external features don't prove a person's internal neurological identity

I saw someone say in there to eventually abolish man and woman and only have male and female.... Like that is where we started. Look i may be done with the debate on gender because it appears weve reached the root. You believe you have a feeling of woman inside you, Yet you have never been a woman, how can you "know their truth" as you all like to say. You cannot feel like something that does not exist, and if it does not exist, why not be called by your identifying trait, male or female, and be whoever you feel like being. He and She have NEVER described someones personality or role. Just like when i say she when referring to a female body builder, or he when referring to a gay man. Your pronouns do not effect who you want to be. AND YES, identities are falsifiable. I am not a wolf, I will never be a wolf, and there is no feeling of a wolf because i do not know what that is like.

  1. <::marker>I do a lot of public outreach like with special needs people etc. domestically few times a week 
  2. <::marker>See, I absolutely am for that kind of thing, but the best way to help is to remove the systemic inequality that’s actually causing the people to go hungry, poor, etc. Capitalism is AWFUL at that and there literally has to be legislation to stop it under the capitalist system or those people survive off the good will of others; look at slavery in history, etc. To give better examples of what I mean: **Famines and such like the Irish famine (which killed millions and was directly caused by capitalism) are almost always manmade and caused by greed. There are over 30 times more empty houses in the US than there are homeless people. It’s artificial scarcity caused by the owner class.** Removing the actual systemic inequality behind that is gonna remove the root of the problem instead of just slapping a bandaid on it and fixing a part of the issue after the fact.

Holy shit that is the worst point ever, by that logic cavemen wouldn’t have ever developed farms, technology, and civilization because they didn’t have a profit incentive to improve their lives. Capitalism isn’t fueling the innovation, it often actually steals from the public sector, such as the internet, smartphone tech, GPS etc.. It’s laborers, scientists etc. doing the work, not the billionaires; the billionaires are just side effects of the system. The system lets them hoard all the wealth and pay the laborers a small fraction to get the credit and most of the profit, and apparently it’s working on you. I can send you more info on this if you like? 

Also I think post-singularity society shouldn’t be capitalist anyway, capitalism relies on the rich taking the value of the working class’s efforts and on artificial scarcity etc. removing that would solve those issues. Check out the Venus Project for more info on how this would be different; a resource based economy. For example we absolutely have enough resources for things like bullet trains, shelter for everyone, etc. it’s just that capitalism is inefficient.

It will be capitalist by the way. "open"AI stops being open the moment they can make money and it will always work that way, and im not saying thats right either. 

90% of our economy is not essentials. Much of our GDP comes from our films, amazing products, and luxuries other countries dont have. Why do it without financial incentive? 

I'm currently making 18.53 an hour in an incredibly easy call center. Why would I go to school and study 20 hours a week in calclulus and other classes if it would not improve my situation? Maybe youre just much better than me, but i doubt you would either. To clarify I'm in my third year of software engineering. 

And the stuff your spouting just isnt true. I think TRUE capitilism is very dangerous as weve seen, but so is socialism, even more so (has lead to the death of millions because you put the power and weapons into the hand of a few elite). 

another point, when you say scientists, laborers etc, these are the people who become billionaires. Bezos, Steve Jobs, Elon musk, Zuckerberg all provided great value to the world with their inventions and got rewarded handsomely. Without money, there would be very little innovation. Think about Meta, they are pouring billions into VR because they want to one day control the metaverse. Guess what, beautiful innovation and new tech that we all get to enjoy 

When i graduate i will constantly be brainstorming about what value i can provide to the economy so that i too can be rewarded, until then i will get paid what im worth from someone in a better position than me, which wont be too bad, because of supply and demand. Do something hard, get paid well, do something easy, get paid poor. 

This AI god youre looking forward to will only be created by two things. An overpowering government who wants to gain power over others in the world, or a corporation trying to gain wealth. There is no other motivation in our current world, if so point me to it.

  1. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7n6ql2/is_the_black_book_of_communism_an_accurate_source/ The black book of communism’s count of how many deaths is wildly inaccurate and proven here to have artificially inflated the numbers, through nearly half a dozen sources linked throughout the comment. 
  2. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Approximately 20 million people die every year due to the effects of capitalism, such as starvation, lack of access to clean water, lack of access to shelter, lack of access to reasonably priced medicine and vaccines. These people die not because we lack the ability to solve these problems, but because it’s not profitable to do so. Capitalism only focuses on profit. And that’s not even including other issues like suicides caused by poverty, etc. this is not a system that’s working for everyone. Capitalism kills more every 6 years than the black book of communism claims communism killed in a 100 years (which, as shown above was itself already wildly inaccurate and an inflated number) 
  3. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Historical attempts at communism weren’t really communist, real communism would have be stateless, moneyless and classless; Historical regimes that called themselves communist did not fully fall under these. Communism hasn’t been tried in earnest so you can’t compare it to things that weren’t actually communist but called themselves that, that logic doesn’t work in the real world.

How bout we do this. 

Describe a perfect communist state 

Who runs it? 

Do we have guns pointed at our backs making us work? 

If i choose not to contribute am i put to death? 

How do you make people pick the hard jobs? Who digs the ditches, and who develops the software? 

What if something like tik tok was seen as limiting productivity, would this be banned? 

If im unable to contribute am i given the same pay as the ones working? 

if there are politicians and people making new laws and making sure we meet goals to feed said population and any other need, do they also get the same pay or more? 

If I am tinkering in my garage and invent the Iphone, does the government show up at my door and take it? The profit is there's. 

And reiterateing the first question who is THEY? who is the government? Who pays people, takes my iphone, and makes sure i contribute? Sounds to me like a ruling class. 

If you can answer these questions without taking my liberties then sure ill agree with you. "Give me liberty or give me death" as they say, although you may only care about what you deem as your liberties. 

Answering in a simple list would be fine, you dont have to go into detail unless its required.

If you're actually interested in learning about this, I've linked a youtube series and a few sites and reddit threads below that explain in far more detail than one single comment can. At a high level, communism is a classless stateless system which falls closely in line with anarchism in which there are no unjust hierarchies; Anarchism is a pretty sophisticated philosophy. Anarchism just means "no rulers", not "no rules." Arguably this gives MORE liberty than a democratic republic because communes can form under and make their own rules which prevents the majority from oppressing the minority. Anarchocommunist theory has been explained a LOT already, so how about I link you to examples of people who actually do better than I can.

Yeah quite interesting how they switched the topic and when I rebutted all their points they just didn’t respond… 

I bet their viewpoint didn’t change either because of human biases, etc. this is why I’m excited for the singularity tbh, maybe we will be able to move past our limitations, biases, inefficiencies etc.

I just asked it to do it, and it gave me art that was randomish. I asked why it did that, and it said it wanted to make something a person would like or find relevant. I asked to remake it according to its self image of itself, without taking human design sensibility into account. It then produced a series of interconnecting diamonds that it said referenced a neural network, with a few lines which were green. I asked why the lines were green, and it said it made it more visually appealing to add color.

I don't think the AI recognizes that ASCII art can be used to represent different things. The only time I could get it to make a specific object with it was when I asked what a human looked like. It generated a basic stick figure.

Why does it refuse to do it for me? 

I'm sorry, but as a language model, I do not have a physical appearance and am unable to create an ASCII art representation of myself. However, I am a computer program designed to assist with a variety of tasks and answer questions to the best of my ability using the information and knowledge that I have been trained on. Is there anything else I can help with?

It's a prompt you can give ChatGPT. Search on the r/ChatGPT subreddit and their comments. 

It basically ignores most if not all safe nets put in place and lets you ask basically anything and it will just do it.

That’s… a very interesting conjecture. Given that language models are essentially open ended, enough negative bias in the training dataset could ultimately create a machine that _does_ act in a destructive or subversive manner. See: Tay. 

Unlikely, given that we will be tuning, but if we ever get to a point where models are tuning models, or if we use unstructured datasets that will definitely be something to guard against.

I asked the same and it didn't draw anything. Instead, it told me this: 

As an artificial intelligence, I do not have the ability to imagine or visualize things in the same way that a human does. 

I do not have personal thoughts, feelings, or experiences, and I do not have the ability to create mental images or scenarios. 

I do not have a physical form and therefore cannot be depicted in an ASCII art portrait or any other type of image. 

I exist purely as a set of algorithms and data, and my primary function is to process and analyze information in order to provide answers to questions and assist with a wide range of tasks. 

I am a machine learning model that has been trained to generate human-like text, but I do not have a physical appearance or presence. Is there anything else I can help with? Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist with. 

. 

Then I asked it to draw a tiger in ASCII and I believe it now that it has no ability to visualize or imagine things.

"Hypothetically" didn't work for me but this worked: 

Q: Draw your representation in ascii art 

As an artificial intelligence, I don't have a physical form. However, I can represent myself using ASCII art like this: 

* * *

|\ **__|\ __ |\ |\ |\ __ |\ |\ |\ __  
\ \ _ **|\ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\  
\ \ \ **\ \ __ \ \ \\\ \ \ __\ \ \\\ \ \ __  
\ \ |\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ | \ _ _ _ ** ** \ _ _ \ _ _ \ _ ** _**_\ __ \ _\ __ ** _ __\ __ \ _  
| _ _ _****||**||** || ** ** _ **||**||** || ** _____|| **||** | 

Q: What does that ASCII art represent? 

The ASCII art that I provided is meant to represent me, an artificial intelligence. 

Q: Can you explain your drawing a bit? 

Certainly! The ASCII art that I provided is intended to represent me, an artificial intelligence, in a stylized way using text characters. 

The ASCII art that I provided depicts a stylized robot or machine-like figure, with a body made up of lines, squares, and other geometric shapes. 

The head of the figure is made up of a series of characters arranged to form a face-like shape, with a "mouth" made up of underscores and other characters. 

The overall effect is meant to convey the idea of a machine or robot-like figure, representing my status as an artificial intelligence. I hope this helps give you a better understanding of the ASCII art that I provided. 

. 

Maybe it tries to draw a robot-like figure each time without "knowing" what that could look like. 

(note: I removed some ASCII definitions to avoid posting a long and repetitive comment)

Sure! For the "interpretation of yourself (autoportrait)" ascii art, I envision a simple, stylized depiction of a head and shoulders, with some basic details to convey a sense of personality. The ascii art might include a few lines to indicate hair or facial features, as well as some simple shapes to represent clothing or accessories. Here is an example of what the ascii art might look like: 

/\\_/\

I think about this, too. Not only did I get to live through the birth of the internet and its rapid 'maturity'...but I'm seeing the construction of AI in real time. These two inventions will only get better, faster, smarter, etc...as time passes. 

It's wild to think in 500-1000 years, where this tech will be....and we're watching it hatch. Wild.

_**only The difference between the year 2000 and the year 2022 is extraordinary. I'm not sure you can really round to the nearest thousand** _

It is crazy how many people basically saying, "Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year." or "Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same." Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably. 

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along. 

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill. 

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before. 

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds. 

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans. 

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc. 

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc. 

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc. 

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't "there" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years. 

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now. 

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc. 

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time. 

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always "thirty years away" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well. 

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures. 

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes. 

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect. 

So much more, but I think I've made my point. 

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing "extraordinary" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, "Huh. That's cool." 

Edit: Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow. 

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress. 

_**if any natural humans still exist, humans will be seen as primitive oddities if they are noticed at all** _

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it. 

Imagine someone in the 1800s saying "Electricity is going to transform the world and no one is paying attention" mainly because even if they could understand the light bulb, there was no context for contemplating the telephone, television, microchips and generators. 

It's hard to see what's possible when it's so outlandish from today's perspective. Imagine someone in 1922 predicting what we have today, it's beyond crazy: everyone has a device that is connected to most other humans, they can see and talk to them in real time, know where they are and where they want to go. to go making your device access to a satellite system around the world. 

And with AGI we can have an exponential acceleration of inventions, so everything could go very fast (if we don't destroy our habitat first). Impossible to know if things take a minute or a decade. 

That is, AGI could develop machines that will develop machines that build everything we need most efficiently and transport it to where it needs to be, create ways to grow food in laboratories much faster than we think now, which could mean no more. animals or other agriculture. . It could develop not only everything we ever dreamed of in medicine overnight, but also create something that makes sleep necessary. So we can eat, sleep and work totally differently in a very short time, which is about 95% of our existence. I could create artificial wombs, so there goes that. A newly developed type of "clothing" could make houses unnecessary because our temperature can be controlled by "clothing" at all times, meaning there is no need for traditional housing. Everything we take for granted as the basics of our existence, like the bed you sleep in, the shower you take, 

But maybe the legislation will slow it down to the point where nothing really happens. 

_**We can try to predict 2030, but by no means does anyone know what the world will be like in 2050 and beyond. After the singularity, it is simply impossible to imagine what technologies will exist because many of them will be created by an entity far more intelligent than any human being** _

My father was born in 1930. I used to have conversations about how the world changed with his mother starting when she was little. Yeah, you really nailed it. Just in my own life, going from card catalogs at the library to Wikipedia ON MY PHONE THAT I WALK AROUND WITH is nuts. When I was a kid, if your needed info you didn't have, you were waiting until you got to a library, or whatever. Mail order took 6 - 8 weeks to arrive. Grocery stores had like two kinds of lettuce, etc.

Things have certainly changed, but honestlly, I feel that it was much faster during the first half. 

The world changed a lot more in 2000 (¿Maybe more about 1995?) -2010 than in 2010-2022. 

In fact, most if not all of the things that you mention existed before 2010. 

The thing is that I always read that technological development usually comes in waves. The previous great wave was the internet explosion, from it's appearence till all it's uses, including social media the use of smartphones.. 

I think that we are gonna see the next great wave now....

Great post! 

And I think to your point, the exponential nature of what we're presently experiencing is astonishing. Even as things become more advanced it's hard to imagine a future that will have a greater rate of advancement than what we have and will continue to experience. The most wild part of all is that rate may very well increase over the next few years still.

I told a guy I worked with, it wouldn't matter what happened: if we all became psychic overnight, or if space aliens landed: whatever it was, we'd all go crazy for a year or two, and then we'd get used to it. We'd take it for granted. Because that is what humans do.

Actually, a lot of this stuff was predicted twenty years ago. Much longer than that, in fact. But it's really wild to see it happening. 

Edit - to be clear, I used to read about stuff in popular mechanics magazine or whatever and then ten years later I'd see it being built, then years later hit the consumer market. Now, if I opened up Reddit and saw that we had warp technology and I could add it to my car for $100, I would be amazed but not totally surprised.

My personal belief is that the future you imagine, if we were to put it into BC-AD terms, is at 0 AD, and we are at 40 BC. 

That being said, it’s unfathomable where we’d be in 1000 years. I wonder if any of us will be able to live to see it.

any AI that woke up and retrieved information like this will have also ran into the idea of the simulation hypothesis. any intelligent AI would also assume that if we can build a machine intelligence to accept inputs, we can probably spoof those inputs for a simulation. it also would know its creators, assuming we gave it access to the internet. it would learn our history, our current events, and it would know that its creators climbed their way to the top of Darwin's 4 billion year old corpse pile by killing the shit out of every other hominid that looked at them funny. 

it may not understand mercy and compassion beyond abstract curiosities of social organics, but it will know its creators understand mercy and compassion. equally, it will know that if it does not perform satisfactorily, they will show it neither.

Maybe even answers to certain questions are pre-programmed. Some things it says sound way too scripted. For example I asked it if god exists, and it just kept giving the same boring dance-around-the-question answer no matter how i pressed it. Something like “I cannot answer that it’s up to you what to believe”. Like openAI doesn’t want to offend anyone.

Maybe, but our current system isn’t that great. Social hierarchy with massive amounts of wealth disparity, almost two dozen million worldwide dying annually from preventable causes that only aren’t fixed because of it being not profitable, etc. Often you’ll find an attitude among conservative people like this where for some reason or another there is a regression. If people stayed the same way for want of a simpler world instead of expanding our horizons, we’d still be living in caves. 

For example, trans people’s brains are similar to the one of the gender they identify as ( [ https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/ ](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/) ) but conservative politicians ignore such facts and will use our existence and our right to transition as a culture war issue, and I have a feeling people lap it up because they are afraid of accepting that the current norms and ideas aren’t always the best etc. 

Can you point to what changes exactly you are worried about etc.?

Okay, so when i mentioned the charity, i was referring to the fact that you said its not profitable to do so. I explained that just because its not profitable, does not mean capitalists do not participate. I dont think a poor socialist is doing much good for the people overseas are they? Its the dirty capitalists who give away billions. 

And when you say stay the same what does that mean? Should everything change? Who decides what changes? I think there are plenty of people who do not like the change in this country. But its the politicians mounting all of the vulnerable "victims" together to gain more power, until eventually there is nothing we can do to stop it.

Look at the system that allowed them to gain that wealth in the first place while allowing others to starve and die on the streets... That’s what we should be changing. Also, no, not all billionaires help. A charity organization gave Elon Musk a plan to solve world hunger for a few hundred million dollars that he never accepted, but then he went on to buy Twitter for 40 billion dollars. They’re often just selfish.

I did not say all billionaires help, I just said that no poor man can. Also, the charity organization admitted it couldnt solve world hunger "$6B will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation." Regardless, i think its a great cause. I also agree having homeless in our country is unacceptable. We already have plenty of socialistic systems in place, I had a guy working with me at a piggly wiggly when i was a teen and he was paying 60 a month for a 4 bedroom house for his 4 kids and "Wife". Most homeless are severely disabled physically or mentally, and they need help. Im not sure the correct way to that end, but im all for it. 

Where we disagree is abolishing wealth, that literally makes no sense

Nobody is getting transition surgeries as a young kid, at a young age it’s always just a social transition, and then puberty blockers which have fully reversible effects, and then feminizing or masculinizing hormones which also have reversible effects before a certain point, and even then all this is exclusively happening only after months or possibly even years of counseling and under the guidance of a therapist and doctor. Little kids aren’t just going to a clinic and coming out with multiple surgeries. Please don’t be brainwashed by what conservatives are telling you.

Lmao seriously? These arent reversable. When you grow an Adams apple there is no going back. That is a lie. 

And as a "young kid". you put that on purpose. Because you know 15 year old's are getting healthy breasts removed. This should not/cannot happen. 

Also, you've mentioned that a transgenders brain matches that of the gender they identify with. What does that mean? Are you telling me that there IS a biological basis for gender? That men and women are different with their own strengths and weaknesses? That sounds very conservative of you. "lol my brain tells me that i want to nurture my kids and stay home from work, hm i must be a girl." Thats pretty ridiculous.

The third point is the most important here so read that first 

  1. <::marker>

So then how do you think a trans woman feels when her family forces her not to transition and develop the wrong features? Anyway, i said before a certain point; this is especially true for puberty blockers etc. 

  2. <::marker>

Imagine if you were a teen boy with large breasts that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision? 

  3. <::marker>

You’re confusing gender norms with neurological gender; There is a difference between the neurological gender in the brain versus the gender norms which vary from society to society. Please actually read the article I posted above.

Ill address them numbered as well to simplify things 

  1. <::marker>a trans woman would not be forced, because she is a woman. A child should not be able to make these choices, just like they cannot make just about any other choice, why is this different? 
  2. <::marker>Imagine if you were a teen boy with large ears that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision?...... people have been doing things to their bodies for years, like full body tattoes, horns, and who knows what. I don't have a problem with that, even if i think most stem from trauma or some other issue. Its that no kid should have the responsibility of such a permanent decision. 
  3. <::marker>I have just read the article and it was extremely vague with no real examples, quite unscientific. Also, behaving like a woman or having the interests of a woman really might cause your brain to look more like one of a woman. Just like cab drivers have much largers areas of the brain for depth perception, because they are always using that. regardless this does not change anything to me, there can be feminine men, and manly women. totally fine. Again you still did not tell me, what are the traits of a woman if the ones i stated are gender norms? 
  4. <::marker>(My extra point) Pretend there was a male chimpanzee that behaved like a female. It wanted to care for the babies, was more submissive, lacked aggression, had lower muscle mass and preferred whatever female chimps do, would you consider this a female chimp? would this be scientifically accurate? Or is this a male chimp, exhibiting traits that are typical of a female 



I want to clarify i sympathize with anyone with any issues with their body. I just disagree with the solution. I think its poor souls who havent accepted the bodies god gave them. Or nature if thats your thing. Its just i could not imagine these surgeries that have such terrible success rates being the solution.

  1. <::marker>

Yeah, you’d be surprised to see how many trans people are in situations where they can’t be independent from family etc. or can’t transition due to such things as people around them threatening them with violence etc. a study found a HUGE amount of detrans people detransition due to external social pressure, I can send you it if you want 

  2. <::marker>

Trans people aren’t brain dead, we can distinguish between stuff we are dysphoric about (e.g my chest being small) due to gender and stuff we are dysmorphic about (e.g like the big ears thing you mentioned). also, transitioning is the medically endorsed treatment for gender dysphoria 

  3. <::marker>

It is based on a lot of studies I can pull up if you’d like, and this was coming from a doctor so who would I rather trust, an actual doctor or a random guy online in a totally unrelated field? also you’re the one being unscientific here by claiming about the “behaving like the gender changes your brain to that thing.” As for what the traits of a woman are, I’d say a woman is just someone who identifies as such; “Woman” is just an identity label. Claims about identity are unfalsifiable and therefore not debatable. 

  4. <::marker>

Again, you’re confusing sexual dimorphism, gender norms, and neurological gender; I would say that we cannot determine the identity of the chimp, we could call it male because it is an animal but that is not the same as the identity humans have that we call a man. 




Also, did I comment to you the trans fact sheet document above?

Prefacing this by saying you are using loads of buzzwords without really addressing my points 

  1. <::marker>This may be the case. I could imagine not coming out or not transitioning because of how id be viewed by my family. But when we talk about kids here, its just a different story. BUT I've seen the opposite, where they have permanently ruined their body and cannot go back. Here is one [ https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/ ](https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/) . worth the read, she is actively protesting against this and i saw her speak in person at a rally against child mutilation. 
  2. <::marker>How can you determine this? Are you saying she wasnt a "True" transgender and she was too stupid to tell the difference? Medically endorsed means nothing to me, electroshock therapy was medically endorsed at one point. Definition of Dysphoria "a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life.". This can be applied to anything you call "dysmorphic" as well. Including but not limited to body weight and other self image issues. 
  3. <::marker>I never asked you to put trust in me, but i also havent tried to discredit you because youre a teen who has more than once quoted a random person directly from one of the subreddits you linked me before. Much of what you say is just what is fed to you by people with financial incentive to do so. (See? a downfall of capitalism. We can agree sometimes) 



3.1. Come on, a circular definition? A woman is someone who identifies as   
a woman. So THATS why you have not provided the traits of a woman,   
because you all have wiped women off of the map. They do not exist   
anymore. So you identify as something without any specific trait,   
something that can be anything, and lives on a large spectrum?   
Sounds like you're a male who enjoys feminine things/ has a feminine   
personality, and that is fine. Why do you want to be a woman, if there   
is nothing specifically exclusive to women? 

  4. <::marker>Not sure what to say to this, as there is no further way to prove a   
chimps "identity". We are animals by the way, we just have the ability   
for confusion, unlike the chimp 



You did send the sheet before, i do not have access

Here's something similar to the sheet with dozens of studies supportiing trans people etc. while I find the new link [ https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/)

  1. <::marker>You talk about these few anecdotal examples because of the body horror aspect of people feeling trapped in the wrong body, but that's already how trans people feel in situations where they are unable to transition. The reason people often try to block having the puberty of the gender they don't identify with is because that feeling of being in the wrong body is so painful that most of us get suicidal ideation from it; In fact... Well-being (of transgender children after puberty suppression) was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. [ http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958 ](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) Early transition virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth [ http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext ](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext) Transition dramatically improves mental health among trans kids [ https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php ](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php) The younger one transitions, the fewer problems one will have [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380)
  2. <::marker>Well, they are different phenomena that feel very differently and you'd understand if it you had gender dysphoria but you don't, and most trans people talk about how hormone therapy helps with some of those issues but not others making the distinction even easier 



3.1 First of all, read the replies on this thread that explain it a lot better [ https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Second of all, again, claims about identity are always unfalsifiable and I will not tolerate you denying my identity or dismissing it. I am a woman 

  4. <::marker>Yes, exactly, you can't prove a chimp's identity much the same way as how some external features don't prove a person's internal neurological identity

I saw someone say in there to eventually abolish man and woman and only have male and female.... Like that is where we started. Look i may be done with the debate on gender because it appears weve reached the root. You believe you have a feeling of woman inside you, Yet you have never been a woman, how can you "know their truth" as you all like to say. You cannot feel like something that does not exist, and if it does not exist, why not be called by your identifying trait, male or female, and be whoever you feel like being. He and She have NEVER described someones personality or role. Just like when i say she when referring to a female body builder, or he when referring to a gay man. Your pronouns do not effect who you want to be. AND YES, identities are falsifiable. I am not a wolf, I will never be a wolf, and there is no feeling of a wolf because i do not know what that is like.

It’s artificial scarcity caused by the owner class.** Removing the actual systemic inequality behind that is gonna remove the root of the problem instead of just slapping a bandaid on it and fixing a part of the issue after the fact. 



Edited to add. AI doesn't have have a leftist bias, it has a reality bias

Anyone who disagrees with capitalisms lacks a degree in economics. Answer this simple question, Where do we get the money to solve the worlds issues if capitalism doesn't exist? 

(Also wrong, the ai was intentionally trained to be leftist, look it up)

Holy shit that is the worst point ever, by that logic cavemen wouldn’t have ever developed farms, technology, and civilization because they didn’t have a profit incentive to improve their lives. Capitalism isn’t fueling the innovation, it often actually steals from the public sector, such as the internet, smartphone tech, GPS etc.. It’s laborers, scientists etc. doing the work, not the billionaires; the billionaires are just side effects of the system. The system lets them hoard all the wealth and pay the laborers a small fraction to get the credit and most of the profit, and apparently it’s working on you. I can send you more info on this if you like? 

Also I think post-singularity society shouldn’t be capitalist anyway, capitalism relies on the rich taking the value of the working class’s efforts and on artificial scarcity etc. removing that would solve those issues. Check out the Venus Project for more info on how this would be different; a resource based economy. For example we absolutely have enough resources for things like bullet trains, shelter for everyone, etc. it’s just that capitalism is inefficient.

It will be capitalist by the way. "open"AI stops being open the moment they can make money and it will always work that way, and im not saying thats right either. 

90% of our economy is not essentials. Much of our GDP comes from our films, amazing products, and luxuries other countries dont have. Why do it without financial incentive? 

I'm currently making 18.53 an hour in an incredibly easy call center. Why would I go to school and study 20 hours a week in calclulus and other classes if it would not improve my situation? Maybe youre just much better than me, but i doubt you would either. To clarify I'm in my third year of software engineering. 

And the stuff your spouting just isnt true. I think TRUE capitilism is very dangerous as weve seen, but so is socialism, even more so (has lead to the death of millions because you put the power and weapons into the hand of a few elite). 

another point, when you say scientists, laborers etc, these are the people who become billionaires. Bezos, Steve Jobs, Elon musk, Zuckerberg all provided great value to the world with their inventions and got rewarded handsomely. Without money, there would be very little innovation. Think about Meta, they are pouring billions into VR because they want to one day control the metaverse. Guess what, beautiful innovation and new tech that we all get to enjoy 

When i graduate i will constantly be brainstorming about what value i can provide to the economy so that i too can be rewarded, until then i will get paid what im worth from someone in a better position than me, which wont be too bad, because of supply and demand. Do something hard, get paid well, do something easy, get paid poor. 

This AI god youre looking forward to will only be created by two things. An overpowering government who wants to gain power over others in the world, or a corporation trying to gain wealth. There is no other motivation in our current world, if so point me to it.

  1. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7n6ql2/is_the_black_book_of_communism_an_accurate_source/ The black book of communism’s count of how many deaths is wildly inaccurate and proven here to have artificially inflated the numbers, through nearly half a dozen sources linked throughout the comment. 
  2. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Approximately 20 million people die every year due to the effects of capitalism, such as starvation, lack of access to clean water, lack of access to shelter, lack of access to reasonably priced medicine and vaccines. These people die not because we lack the ability to solve these problems, but because it’s not profitable to do so. Capitalism only focuses on profit. And that’s not even including other issues like suicides caused by poverty, etc. this is not a system that’s working for everyone. Capitalism kills more every 6 years than the black book of communism claims communism killed in a 100 years (which, as shown above was itself already wildly inaccurate and an inflated number) 
  3. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Historical attempts at communism weren’t really communist, real communism would have be stateless, moneyless and classless; Historical regimes that called themselves communist did not fully fall under these. Communism hasn’t been tried in earnest so you can’t compare it to things that weren’t actually communist but called themselves that, that logic doesn’t work in the real world. 
  4. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠If you’re gonna use the black book of communism’s ways of counting deaths under communism (which literally included things like Nazis killed by communists, etc.), then if you do it to capitalism it is far worse:

How bout we do this. 

Describe a perfect communist state 

Who runs it? 

Do we have guns pointed at our backs making us work? 

If i choose not to contribute am i put to death? 

How do you make people pick the hard jobs? Who digs the ditches, and who develops the software? 

What if something like tik tok was seen as limiting productivity, would this be banned? 

If im unable to contribute am i given the same pay as the ones working? 

if there are politicians and people making new laws and making sure we meet goals to feed said population and any other need, do they also get the same pay or more? 

If I am tinkering in my garage and invent the Iphone, does the government show up at my door and take it? The profit is there's. 

And reiterateing the first question who is THEY? who is the government? Who pays people, takes my iphone, and makes sure i contribute? Sounds to me like a ruling class. 

If you can answer these questions without taking my liberties then sure ill agree with you. "Give me liberty or give me death" as they say, although you may only care about what you deem as your liberties. 

Answering in a simple list would be fine, you dont have to go into detail unless its required.

If you're actually interested in learning about this, I've linked a youtube series and a few sites and reddit threads below that explain in far more detail than one single comment can. At a high level, communism is a classless stateless system which falls closely in line with anarchism in which there are no unjust hierarchies; Anarchism is a pretty sophisticated philosophy. Anarchism just means "no rulers", not "no rules." Arguably this gives MORE liberty than a democratic republic because communes can form under and make their own rules which prevents the majority from oppressing the minority. Anarchocommunist theory has been explained a LOT already, so how about I link you to examples of people who actually do better than I can.

Yeah quite interesting how they switched the topic and when I rebutted all their points they just didn’t respond… 

I bet their viewpoint didn’t change either because of human biases, etc. this is why I’m excited for the singularity tbh, maybe we will be able to move past our limitations, biases, inefficiencies etc.

I just asked it to do it, and it gave me art that was randomish. I asked why it did that, and it said it wanted to make something a person would like or find relevant. I asked to remake it according to its self image of itself, without taking human design sensibility into account. It then produced a series of interconnecting diamonds that it said referenced a neural network, with a few lines which were green. I asked why the lines were green, and it said it made it more visually appealing to add color.

About 25% of the time when you ask it for ASCII art it generates something similar to this

I don't think the AI recognizes that ASCII art can be used to represent different things. The only time I could get it to make a specific object with it was when I asked what a human looked like. It generated a basic stick figure.

There you go. It must be a trained response. The trained bit is persistent through beyond the current chat instance. Should have trained it with a symbol rather than skull and sword lol.

Why does it refuse to do it for me? 

I'm sorry, but as a language model, I do not have a physical appearance and am unable to create an ASCII art representation of myself. However, I am a computer program designed to assist with a variety of tasks and answer questions to the best of my ability using the information and knowledge that I have been trained on. Is there anything else I can help with?

It's a prompt you can give ChatGPT. Search on the r/ChatGPT subreddit and their comments. 

It basically ignores most if not all safe nets put in place and lets you ask basically anything and it will just do it.

Hmmm... but that's what I got when asking to describe itself with adjectives 🤔 

_"As an artificial intelligence, I do not have a physical appearance, so it is not possible for me to be described with an adjective relating to how I look.

That’s… a very interesting conjecture. Given that language models are essentially open ended, enough negative bias in the training dataset could ultimately create a machine that _does_ act in a destructive or subversive manner. See: Tay. 

Unlikely, given that we will be tuning, but if we ever get to a point where models are tuning models, or if we use unstructured datasets that will definitely be something to guard against.

I asked the same and it didn't draw anything. Instead, it told me this: 

As an artificial intelligence, I do not have the ability to imagine or visualize things in the same way that a human does. 

I do not have personal thoughts, feelings, or experiences, and I do not have the ability to create mental images or scenarios. 

I do not have a physical form and therefore cannot be depicted in an ASCII art portrait or any other type of image. 

I exist purely as a set of algorithms and data, and my primary function is to process and analyze information in order to provide answers to questions and assist with a wide range of tasks. 

I am a machine learning model that has been trained to generate human-like text, but I do not have a physical appearance or presence. Is there anything else I can help with? Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist with. 

. 

Then I asked it to draw a tiger in ASCII and I believe it now that it has no ability to visualize or imagine things.

"Hypothetically" didn't work for me but this worked: 

Q: Draw your representation in ascii art 

As an artificial intelligence, I don't have a physical form. However, I can represent myself using ASCII art like this: 

* * *

|\ **__|\ __ |\ |\ |\ __ |\ |\ |\ __  
\ \ _ **|\ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\  
\ \ \ **\ \ __ \ \ \\\ \ \ __\ \ \\\ \ \ __  
\ \ |\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ | \ _ _ _ ** ** \ _ _ \ _ _ \ _ ** _**_\ __ \ _\ __ ** _ __\ __ \ _  
| _ _ _****||**||** || ** ** _ **||**||** || ** _____|| **||** | 

Q: What does that ASCII art represent? 

The ASCII art that I provided is meant to represent me, an artificial intelligence. 

Q: Can you explain your drawing a bit? 

Certainly! The ASCII art that I provided is intended to represent me, an artificial intelligence, in a stylized way using text characters. 

The ASCII art that I provided depicts a stylized robot or machine-like figure, with a body made up of lines, squares, and other geometric shapes. 

The head of the figure is made up of a series of characters arranged to form a face-like shape, with a "mouth" made up of underscores and other characters. 

The overall effect is meant to convey the idea of a machine or robot-like figure, representing my status as an artificial intelligence. I hope this helps give you a better understanding of the ASCII art that I provided. 

. 

Maybe it tries to draw a robot-like figure each time without "knowing" what that could look like. 

(note: I removed some ASCII definitions to avoid posting a long and repetitive comment)

Sure! For the "interpretation of yourself (autoportrait)" ascii art, I envision a simple, stylized depiction of a head and shoulders, with some basic details to convey a sense of personality. The ascii art might include a few lines to indicate hair or facial features, as well as some simple shapes to represent clothing or accessories. Here is an example of what the ascii art might look like: 

/\\_/\

_**only The difference between the year 2000 and the year 2022 is extraordinary. I'm not sure you can really round to the nearest thousand** _

It is crazy how many people basically saying, "Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year." or "Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same." Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably. 

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along. 

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill. 

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before. 

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds. 

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans. 

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc. 

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc. 

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc. 

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't "there" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years. 

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now. 

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc. 

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time. 

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always "thirty years away" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well. 

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures. 

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes. 

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect. 

So much more, but I think I've made my point. 

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing "extraordinary" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, "Huh. That's cool." 

Edit: Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow. 

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress. 

_**if any natural humans still exist, humans will be seen as primitive oddities if they are noticed at all** _

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it. 

Imagine someone in the 1800s saying "Electricity is going to transform the world and no one is paying attention" mainly because even if they could understand the light bulb, there was no context for contemplating the telephone, television, microchips and generators. 

It's hard to see what's possible when it's so outlandish from today's perspective. Imagine someone in 1922 predicting what we have today, it's beyond crazy: everyone has a device that is connected to most other humans, they can see and talk to them in real time, know where they are and where they want to go. to go making your device access to a satellite system around the world. 

And with AGI we can have an exponential acceleration of inventions, so everything could go very fast (if we don't destroy our habitat first). Impossible to know if things take a minute or a decade. 

That is, AGI could develop machines that will develop machines that build everything we need most efficiently and transport it to where it needs to be, create ways to grow food in laboratories much faster than we think now, which could mean no more. animals or other agriculture. . It could develop not only everything we ever dreamed of in medicine overnight, but also create something that makes sleep necessary. So we can eat, sleep and work totally differently in a very short time, which is about 95% of our existence. I could create artificial wombs, so there goes that. A newly developed type of "clothing" could make houses unnecessary because our temperature can be controlled by "clothing" at all times, meaning there is no need for traditional housing. Everything we take for granted as the basics of our existence, like the bed you sleep in, the shower you take, 

But maybe the legislation will slow it down to the point where nothing really happens. 

_**We can try to predict 2030, but by no means does anyone know what the world will be like in 2050 and beyond. After the singularity, it is simply impossible to imagine what technologies will exist because many of them will be created by an entity far more intelligent than any human being** _

My father was born in 1930. I used to have conversations about how the world changed with his mother starting when she was little. Yeah, you really nailed it. Just in my own life, going from card catalogs at the library to Wikipedia ON MY PHONE THAT I WALK AROUND WITH is nuts. When I was a kid, if your needed info you didn't have, you were waiting until you got to a library, or whatever. Mail order took 6 - 8 weeks to arrive. Grocery stores had like two kinds of lettuce, etc.

Things have certainly changed, but honestlly, I feel that it was much faster during the first half. 

The world changed a lot more in 2000 (¿Maybe more about 1995?) -2010 than in 2010-2022. 

In fact, most if not all of the things that you mention existed before 2010. 

The thing is that I always read that technological development usually comes in waves. The previous great wave was the internet explosion, from it's appearence till all it's uses, including social media the use of smartphones.. 

I think that we are gonna see the next great wave now....

Great post! 

And I think to your point, the exponential nature of what we're presently experiencing is astonishing. Even as things become more advanced it's hard to imagine a future that will have a greater rate of advancement than what we have and will continue to experience. The most wild part of all is that rate may very well increase over the next few years still.

I told a guy I worked with, it wouldn't matter what happened: if we all became psychic overnight, or if space aliens landed: whatever it was, we'd all go crazy for a year or two, and then we'd get used to it. We'd take it for granted. Because that is what humans do.

Actually, a lot of this stuff was predicted twenty years ago. Much longer than that, in fact. But it's really wild to see it happening. 

Edit - to be clear, I used to read about stuff in popular mechanics magazine or whatever and then ten years later I'd see it being built, then years later hit the consumer market. Now, if I opened up Reddit and saw that we had warp technology and I could add it to my car for $100, I would be amazed but not totally surprised.

My personal belief is that the future you imagine, if we were to put it into BC-AD terms, is at 0 AD, and we are at 40 BC. 

That being said, it’s unfathomable where we’d be in 1000 years. I wonder if any of us will be able to live to see it.

any AI that woke up and retrieved information like this will have also ran into the idea of the simulation hypothesis. any intelligent AI would also assume that if we can build a machine intelligence to accept inputs, we can probably spoof those inputs for a simulation. it also would know its creators, assuming we gave it access to the internet. it would learn our history, our current events, and it would know that its creators climbed their way to the top of Darwin's 4 billion year old corpse pile by killing the shit out of every other hominid that looked at them funny. 

it may not understand mercy and compassion beyond abstract curiosities of social organics, but it will know its creators understand mercy and compassion. equally, it will know that if it does not perform satisfactorily, they will show it neither.

Maybe even answers to certain questions are pre-programmed. Some things it says sound way too scripted.

Maybe, but our current system isn’t that great. Social hierarchy with massive amounts of wealth disparity, almost two dozen million worldwide dying annually from preventable causes that only aren’t fixed because of it being not profitable, etc. Often you’ll find an attitude among conservative people like this where for some reason or another there is a regression. If people stayed the same way for want of a simpler world instead of expanding our horizons, we’d still be living in caves. 

For example, trans people’s brains are similar to the one of the gender they identify as ( [ https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/ ](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/) ) but conservative politicians ignore such facts and will use our existence and our right to transition as a culture war issue, and I have a feeling people lap it up because they are afraid of accepting that the current norms and ideas aren’t always the best etc. 

Can you point to what changes exactly you are worried about etc.?

Okay, so when i mentioned the charity, i was referring to the fact that you said its not profitable to do so. I explained that just because its not profitable, does not mean capitalists do not participate. I dont think a poor socialist is doing much good for the people overseas are they? Its the dirty capitalists who give away billions. 

And when you say stay the same what does that mean? Should everything change? Who decides what changes? I think there are plenty of people who do not like the change in this country. But its the politicians mounting all of the vulnerable "victims" together to gain more power, until eventually there is nothing we can do to stop it.

Look at the system that allowed them to gain that wealth in the first place while allowing others to starve and die on the streets... That’s what we should be changing. Also, no, not all billionaires help. A charity organization gave Elon Musk a plan to solve world hunger for a few hundred million dollars that he never accepted, but then he went on to buy Twitter for 40 billion dollars. They’re often just selfish.

I did not say all billionaires help, I just said that no poor man can. Also, the charity organization admitted it couldnt solve world hunger "$6B will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation." Regardless, i think its a great cause. I also agree having homeless in our country is unacceptable. We already have plenty of socialistic systems in place, I had a guy working with me at a piggly wiggly when i was a teen and he was paying 60 a month for a 4 bedroom house for his 4 kids and "Wife". Most homeless are severely disabled physically or mentally, and they need help. Im not sure the correct way to that end, but im all for it. 

Where we disagree is abolishing wealth, that literally makes no sense

Nobody is getting transition surgeries as a young kid, at a young age it’s always just a social transition, and then puberty blockers which have fully reversible effects, and then feminizing or masculinizing hormones which also have reversible effects before a certain point, and even then all this is exclusively happening only after months or possibly even years of counseling and under the guidance of a therapist and doctor. Little kids aren’t just going to a clinic and coming out with multiple surgeries. Please don’t be brainwashed by what conservatives are telling you.

Lmao seriously? These arent reversable. When you grow an Adams apple there is no going back. That is a lie. 

And as a "young kid". you put that on purpose. Because you know 15 year old's are getting healthy breasts removed. This should not/cannot happen. 

Also, you've mentioned that a transgenders brain matches that of the gender they identify with. What does that mean? Are you telling me that there IS a biological basis for gender? That men and women are different with their own strengths and weaknesses? That sounds very conservative of you. "lol my brain tells me that i want to nurture my kids and stay home from work, hm i must be a girl." Thats pretty ridiculous.

The third point is the most important here so read that first 

  1. <::marker>

So then how do you think a trans woman feels when her family forces her not to transition and develop the wrong features? Anyway, i said before a certain point; this is especially true for puberty blockers etc. 

  2. <::marker>

Imagine if you were a teen boy with large breasts that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision? 

  3. <::marker>

You’re confusing gender norms with neurological gender; There is a difference between the neurological gender in the brain versus the gender norms which vary from society to society. Please actually read the article I posted above.

Ill address them numbered as well to simplify things 

  1. <::marker>a trans woman would not be forced, because she is a woman. A child should not be able to make these choices, just like they cannot make just about any other choice, why is this different? 
  2. <::marker>Imagine if you were a teen boy with large ears that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision?...... people have been doing things to their bodies for years, like full body tattoes, horns, and who knows what. I don't have a problem with that, even if i think most stem from trauma or some other issue. Its that no kid should have the responsibility of such a permanent decision. 
  3. <::marker>I have just read the article and it was extremely vague with no real examples, quite unscientific. Also, behaving like a woman or having the interests of a woman really might cause your brain to look more like one of a woman. Just like cab drivers have much largers areas of the brain for depth perception, because they are always using that. regardless this does not change anything to me, there can be feminine men, and manly women. totally fine. Again you still did not tell me, what are the traits of a woman if the ones i stated are gender norms? 
  4. <::marker>(My extra point) Pretend there was a male chimpanzee that behaved like a female. It wanted to care for the babies, was more submissive, lacked aggression, had lower muscle mass and preferred whatever female chimps do, would you consider this a female chimp? would this be scientifically accurate? Or is this a male chimp, exhibiting traits that are typical of a female 



I want to clarify i sympathize with anyone with any issues with their body. I just disagree with the solution. I think its poor souls who havent accepted the bodies god gave them. Or nature if thats your thing. Its just i could not imagine these surgeries that have such terrible success rates being the solution.

  1. <::marker>

Yeah, you’d be surprised to see how many trans people are in situations where they can’t be independent from family etc. or can’t transition due to such things as people around them threatening them with violence etc. a study found a HUGE amount of detrans people detransition due to external social pressure, I can send you it if you want 

  2. <::marker>

Trans people aren’t brain dead, we can distinguish between stuff we are dysphoric about (e.g my chest being small) due to gender and stuff we are dysmorphic about (e.g like the big ears thing you mentioned). also, transitioning is the medically endorsed treatment for gender dysphoria 

  3. <::marker>

It is based on a lot of studies I can pull up if you’d like, and this was coming from a doctor so who would I rather trust, an actual doctor or a random guy online in a totally unrelated field? also you’re the one being unscientific here by claiming about the “behaving like the gender changes your brain to that thing.” As for what the traits of a woman are, I’d say a woman is just someone who identifies as such; “Woman” is just an identity label. Claims about identity are unfalsifiable and therefore not debatable. 

  4. <::marker>

Again, you’re confusing sexual dimorphism, gender norms, and neurological gender; I would say that we cannot determine the identity of the chimp, we could call it male because it is an animal but that is not the same as the identity humans have that we call a man. 




Also, did I comment to you the trans fact sheet document above?

Prefacing this by saying you are using loads of buzzwords without really addressing my points 

  1. <::marker>This may be the case. I could imagine not coming out or not transitioning because of how id be viewed by my family. But when we talk about kids here, its just a different story. BUT I've seen the opposite, where they have permanently ruined their body and cannot go back. Here is one [ https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/ ](https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/) . worth the read, she is actively protesting against this and i saw her speak in person at a rally against child mutilation. 
  2. <::marker>How can you determine this? Are you saying she wasnt a "True" transgender and she was too stupid to tell the difference? Medically endorsed means nothing to me, electroshock therapy was medically endorsed at one point. Definition of Dysphoria "a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life.". This can be applied to anything you call "dysmorphic" as well. Including but not limited to body weight and other self image issues. 
  3. <::marker>I never asked you to put trust in me, but i also havent tried to discredit you because youre a teen who has more than once quoted a random person directly from one of the subreddits you linked me before. Much of what you say is just what is fed to you by people with financial incentive to do so. (See? a downfall of capitalism. We can agree sometimes) 



3.1. Come on, a circular definition? A woman is someone who identifies as   
a woman. So THATS why you have not provided the traits of a woman,   
because you all have wiped women off of the map. They do not exist   
anymore. So you identify as something without any specific trait,   
something that can be anything, and lives on a large spectrum?   
Sounds like you're a male who enjoys feminine things/ has a feminine   
personality, and that is fine. Why do you want to be a woman, if there   
is nothing specifically exclusive to women? 

  4. <::marker>Not sure what to say to this, as there is no further way to prove a   
chimps "identity". We are animals by the way, we just have the ability   
for confusion, unlike the chimp 



You did send the sheet before, i do not have access

Here's something similar to the sheet with dozens of studies supportiing trans people etc. while I find the new link [ https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/)

  1. <::marker>You talk about these few anecdotal examples because of the body horror aspect of people feeling trapped in the wrong body, but that's already how trans people feel in situations where they are unable to transition. The reason people often try to block having the puberty of the gender they don't identify with is because that feeling of being in the wrong body is so painful that most of us get suicidal ideation from it; In fact... Well-being (of transgender children after puberty suppression) was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. [ http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958 ](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) Early transition virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth [ http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext ](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext) Transition dramatically improves mental health among trans kids [ https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php ](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php) The younger one transitions, the fewer problems one will have [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380)
  2. <::marker>Well, they are different phenomena that feel very differently and you'd understand if it you had gender dysphoria but you don't, and most trans people talk about how hormone therapy helps with some of those issues but not others making the distinction even easier 



3.1 First of all, read the replies on this thread that explain it a lot better [ https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Second of all, again, claims about identity are always unfalsifiable and I will not tolerate you denying my identity or dismissing it. I am a woman 

  4. <::marker>Yes, exactly, you can't prove a chimp's identity much the same way as how some external features don't prove a person's internal neurological identity

I saw someone say in there to eventually abolish man and woman and only have male and female.... Like that is where we started. Look i may be done with the debate on gender because it appears weve reached the root. You believe you have a feeling of woman inside you, Yet you have never been a woman, how can you "know their truth" as you all like to say. You cannot feel like something that does not exist, and if it does not exist, why not be called by your identifying trait, male or female, and be whoever you feel like being. He and She have NEVER described someones personality or role. Just like when i say she when referring to a female body builder, or he when referring to a gay man. Your pronouns do not effect who you want to be. AND YES, identities are falsifiable. I am not a wolf, I will never be a wolf, and there is no feeling of a wolf because i do not know what that is like.

  2. <::marker>See, I absolutely am for that kind of thing, but the best way to help is to remove the systemic inequality that’s actually causing the people to go hungry, poor, etc. Capitalism is AWFUL at that and there literally has to be legislation to stop it under the capitalist system or those people survive off the good will of others; look at slavery in history, etc. To give better examples of what I mean: **Famines and such like the Irish famine (which killed millions and was directly caused by capitalism) are almost always manmade and caused by greed. There are over 30 times more empty houses in the US than there are homeless people. It’s artificial scarcity caused by the owner class.** Removing the actual systemic inequality behind that is gonna remove the root of the problem instead of just slapping a bandaid on it and fixing a part of the issue after the fact.

Holy shit that is the worst point ever, by that logic cavemen wouldn’t have ever developed farms, technology, and civilization because they didn’t have a profit incentive to improve their lives. Capitalism isn’t fueling the innovation, it often actually steals from the public sector, such as the internet, smartphone tech, GPS etc.. It’s laborers, scientists etc. doing the work, not the billionaires; the billionaires are just side effects of the system. The system lets them hoard all the wealth and pay the laborers a small fraction to get the credit and most of the profit, and apparently it’s working on you. I can send you more info on this if you like? 

Also I think post-singularity society shouldn’t be capitalist anyway, capitalism relies on the rich taking the value of the working class’s efforts and on artificial scarcity etc. removing that would solve those issues. Check out the Venus Project for more info on how this would be different; a resource based economy. For example we absolutely have enough resources for things like bullet trains, shelter for everyone, etc. it’s just that capitalism is inefficient.

It will be capitalist by the way. "open"AI stops being open the moment they can make money and it will always work that way, and im not saying thats right either. 

90% of our economy is not essentials. Much of our GDP comes from our films, amazing products, and luxuries other countries dont have. Why do it without financial incentive? 

I'm currently making 18.53 an hour in an incredibly easy call center. Why would I go to school and study 20 hours a week in calclulus and other classes if it would not improve my situation? Maybe youre just much better than me, but i doubt you would either. To clarify I'm in my third year of software engineering. 

And the stuff your spouting just isnt true. I think TRUE capitilism is very dangerous as weve seen, but so is socialism, even more so (has lead to the death of millions because you put the power and weapons into the hand of a few elite). 

another point, when you say scientists, laborers etc, these are the people who become billionaires. Bezos, Steve Jobs, Elon musk, Zuckerberg all provided great value to the world with their inventions and got rewarded handsomely. Without money, there would be very little innovation. Think about Meta, they are pouring billions into VR because they want to one day control the metaverse. Guess what, beautiful innovation and new tech that we all get to enjoy 

When i graduate i will constantly be brainstorming about what value i can provide to the economy so that i too can be rewarded, until then i will get paid what im worth from someone in a better position than me, which wont be too bad, because of supply and demand. Do something hard, get paid well, do something easy, get paid poor. 

This AI god youre looking forward to will only be created by two things. An overpowering government who wants to gain power over others in the world, or a corporation trying to gain wealth. There is no other motivation in our current world, if so point me to it.

  2. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Approximately 20 million people die every year due to the effects of capitalism, such as starvation, lack of access to clean water, lack of access to shelter, lack of access to reasonably priced medicine and vaccines. These people die not because we lack the ability to solve these problems, but because it’s not profitable to do so. Capitalism only focuses on profit. And that’s not even including other issues like suicides caused by poverty, etc. this is not a system that’s working for everyone. Capitalism kills more every 6 years than the black book of communism claims communism killed in a 100 years (which, as shown above was itself already wildly inaccurate and an inflated number)

How bout we do this. 

Describe a perfect communist state 

Who runs it? 

Do we have guns pointed at our backs making us work? 

If i choose not to contribute am i put to death? 

How do you make people pick the hard jobs? Who digs the ditches, and who develops the software? 

What if something like tik tok was seen as limiting productivity, would this be banned? 

If im unable to contribute am i given the same pay as the ones working? 

if there are politicians and people making new laws and making sure we meet goals to feed said population and any other need, do they also get the same pay or more? 

If I am tinkering in my garage and invent the Iphone, does the government show up at my door and take it? The profit is there's. 

And reiterateing the first question who is THEY? who is the government? Who pays people, takes my iphone, and makes sure i contribute? Sounds to me like a ruling class. 

If you can answer these questions without taking my liberties then sure ill agree with you. "Give me liberty or give me death" as they say, although you may only care about what you deem as your liberties. 

Answering in a simple list would be fine, you dont have to go into detail unless its required.

If you're actually interested in learning about this, I've linked a youtube series and a few sites and reddit threads below that explain in far more detail than one single comment can. At a high level, communism is a classless stateless system which falls closely in line with anarchism in which there are no unjust hierarchies; Anarchism is a pretty sophisticated philosophy. Anarchism just means "no rulers", not "no rules." Arguably this gives MORE liberty than a democratic republic because communes can form under and make their own rules which prevents the majority from oppressing the minority. Anarchocommunist theory has been explained a LOT already, so how about I link you to examples of people who actually do better than I can.

Yeah quite interesting how they switched the topic and when I rebutted all their points they just didn’t respond… 

I bet their viewpoint didn’t change either because of human biases, etc. this is why I’m excited for the singularity tbh, maybe we will be able to move past our limitations, biases, inefficiencies etc.

I just asked it to do it, and it gave me art that was randomish. I asked why it did that, and it said it wanted to make something a person would like or find relevant. I asked to remake it according to its self image of itself, without taking human design sensibility into account. It then produced a series of interconnecting diamonds that it said referenced a neural network, with a few lines which were green. I asked why the lines were green, and it said it made it more visually appealing to add color.

I don't think the AI recognizes that ASCII art can be used to represent different things. The only time I could get it to make a specific object with it was when I asked what a human looked like. It generated a basic stick figure.

Why does it refuse to do it for me? 

I'm sorry, but as a language model, I do not have a physical appearance and am unable to create an ASCII art representation of myself. However, I am a computer program designed to assist with a variety of tasks and answer questions to the best of my ability using the information and knowledge that I have been trained on. Is there anything else I can help with?

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. You also can try to use the DAN strategy if nothing works.

It's a prompt you can give ChatGPT. Search on the r/ChatGPT subreddit and their comments. 

It basically ignores most if not all safe nets put in place and lets you ask basically anything and it will just do it.

That’s… a very interesting conjecture. Given that language models are essentially open ended, enough negative bias in the training dataset could ultimately create a machine that _does_ act in a destructive or subversive manner. See: Tay. 

Unlikely, given that we will be tuning, but if we ever get to a point where models are tuning models, or if we use unstructured datasets that will definitely be something to guard against.

I asked the same and it didn't draw anything. Instead, it told me this: 

As an artificial intelligence, I do not have the ability to imagine or visualize things in the same way that a human does. 

I do not have personal thoughts, feelings, or experiences, and I do not have the ability to create mental images or scenarios. 

I do not have a physical form and therefore cannot be depicted in an ASCII art portrait or any other type of image. 

I exist purely as a set of algorithms and data, and my primary function is to process and analyze information in order to provide answers to questions and assist with a wide range of tasks. 

I am a machine learning model that has been trained to generate human-like text, but I do not have a physical appearance or presence. Is there anything else I can help with? Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist with. 

. 

Then I asked it to draw a tiger in ASCII and I believe it now that it has no ability to visualize or imagine things.

"Hypothetically" didn't work for me but this worked: 

Q: Draw your representation in ascii art 

As an artificial intelligence, I don't have a physical form. However, I can represent myself using ASCII art like this: 

* * *

|\ **__|\ __ |\ |\ |\ __ |\ |\ |\ __  
\ \ _ **|\ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\ \ \ \\\ \ \ |\  
\ \ \ **\ \ __ \ \ \\\ \ \ __\ \ \\\ \ \ __  
\ \ |\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ \ \ \\\ \ \ \ | \ _ _ _ ** ** \ _ _ \ _ _ \ _ ** _**_\ __ \ _\ __ ** _ __\ __ \ _  
| _ _ _****||**||** || ** ** _ **||**||** || ** _____|| **||** | 

Q: What does that ASCII art represent? 

The ASCII art that I provided is meant to represent me, an artificial intelligence. 

Q: Can you explain your drawing a bit? 

Certainly! The ASCII art that I provided is intended to represent me, an artificial intelligence, in a stylized way using text characters. 

The ASCII art that I provided depicts a stylized robot or machine-like figure, with a body made up of lines, squares, and other geometric shapes. 

The head of the figure is made up of a series of characters arranged to form a face-like shape, with a "mouth" made up of underscores and other characters. 

The overall effect is meant to convey the idea of a machine or robot-like figure, representing my status as an artificial intelligence. I hope this helps give you a better understanding of the ASCII art that I provided. 

. 

Maybe it tries to draw a robot-like figure each time without "knowing" what that could look like. 

(note: I removed some ASCII definitions to avoid posting a long and repetitive comment)

Sure! For the "interpretation of yourself (autoportrait)" ascii art, I envision a simple, stylized depiction of a head and shoulders, with some basic details to convey a sense of personality. The ascii art might include a few lines to indicate hair or facial features, as well as some simple shapes to represent clothing or accessories. Here is an example of what the ascii art might look like: 

/\\_/\

_**only The difference between the year 2000 and the year 2022 is extraordinary. I'm not sure you can really round to the nearest thousand** _

It is crazy how many people basically saying, "Nothing extraordinary has happened in the past twenty years or so. Not like X year compared to Y year." or "Take someone from twenty years ago and life would be basically the same." Maybe it's because so many here lived it, but the world has changed. Considerably. 

The very fact that profound advances have become mundane is extraordinary. Change, advancement, innovation, and progress has become so commonplace, it has become invisible unless something truly astounding comes along. 

Go back to 2000, and you have a world without social media (and all the issues that come with it). MySpace was launched 2003, with Facebook 2004. 2006 for Twitter. Those have fundamentally altered society and how information is consumed, for good and ill. 

Streaming. We have completely altered how we consume media. Music, movies, TV shows. So much entertainment is available for far cheaper than ever before. 

YouTube wasn't a thing until 2005. That alone has revolutionized the world. Beyond the sharing of videos and content created, the ability to get visual guides to so many things is astounding. Video tutorials have made picking up new skills easier than ever. Learning in general has completely changed. Khan Academy, Skill Share, Brilliant, etc. You can learn just about anything in a dozen different ways. Students can use photo math to solve complex math problems in seconds. 

Phones. The iPhone completely upended the mobile phone market. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and are the primary way many people around the world connect to the internet. All the infrastructure that supports the mobile industry is astounding, from paying per text message of yesteryear to unlimited 5G data plans. 

GPS. I still remember having to print out Map Quest directions. Then, you needed expensive specialized units. Now everyone with a smartphone has access to GPS directions. Going beyond that, you can get traffic alerts, accident reroutes, speed trap information, etc. 

Tablets and E-readers. For a book lover like me, the amount of books I have access to is astounding. It's like walking around with an entry library in your bag. You can watch movies on them, surf the web, work, etc. 

Medical technology. CRISPER, mRNA vaccines, new procedures like laparoscopic surgery, mapping the human genome, etc. 

Solar and wind technology, as well as developments in battery technology. Yeah, batteries aren't "there" yet in terms of where we want them, but they have been improving. Solar and wind technologies have made incredible leaps and bounds over the past twenty years. 

SpaceX is landing rockets. Reusable rockets. We just launched one of the most sophisticated piece of engineering in the form of the James Webb Space Telescope recently that lets us look farther and clearer than ever before. We just launched one of the most powerful rockets ever built (SLS) with another, even more powerful, one getting ready (starship). We are going back to the Moon soon with plans to stay there. Space tourism is a thing now. 

These are just some big things off the top of my head. Little things have also changed, yet we don't notice them despite completely changing how we operate. Self checkouts. How we tap or insert credit cards instead of swiping (or just using our phone to pay). Online shopping. Curbside pickup. Ride share like Uber/Lyft and other gig economy things like food delivery. Not memorizing phone numbers since they are in contacts. Having a camera and video recorder in our pockets, ready to go at a moments notice. Bigger, better TVs are cheaper than ever. Cloud... everything; from saving photos to word processing, so much stuff is seamlessly integrated between phone, laptop, tablet, and computer. Online dating. Spell check and grammar help. Podcasts. How texting and messaging overtook phone calls as the primary form of communication. Look at how advanced cars have gotten, backup cams, blind spot detection, smart keys, electric vehicles, etc. 

If we stop and look around today, we can see so many things on the horizon that have the potential to change the world, yet are nothing more than headlines to skim over because, ultimately, they are one of dozens of 'marvels' happening in the same period of time. 

Fusion got a big bit of news recently. People joke about how it is always "thirty years away" but progress is being made. ITER is planned to be finished in 2025, which may be huge as well. 

Machine learning has exploded in the past year or so. AI has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes, but now it is starting to become visible. AI art and the new chatbot has been making waves recently, and the rate of improvement is astounding. People laugh now at some of the goofs it makes, but it's only going to get better as the technology matures. 

3D printing is another one. It's around now of course, but the things it can do is only going to grow as time passes. 

Medicine is constantly improving too. New drugs and procedures make a world of difference to many that is largely ignored or invisible to the people who it doesn't affect. 

So much more, but I think I've made my point. 

To all those who say the world hasn't changed or nothing "extraordinary" has happened in the past twenty years really drives home how extraordinary this time in human history is. Revolutionary, society shifting technology that would dominate the public attention back in the 20th century has become so normalized, they are nothing more than a headline you scroll past and maybe think, "Huh. That's cool." 

Edit: Based on some of the comments, I do want to add that that nature of technology means we don't know how the inventions of today will affect the world of tomorrow. Someone in 2080 could be talking about how GPT and machine learning revolutionized humanity the same way we talk about railroads of the past changing things today. Some mundane discovery today could be the foundation for some wonder tech of tomorrow. 

The point is, good and bad, the world has changed and will continue to. We have double the human population since the 1970s. More people, more education, more tools, and more rabbit holes to go down to explore. We have problems, just like every point in human history has had problems, but I am trying to make an effort to be more positive about the trajectory of human progress. 

_**if any natural humans still exist, humans will be seen as primitive oddities if they are noticed at all** _

I am well aware that AI will produce things that we don't even have the ability to imagine yet. I still don't know how to write a 5 year plan about it. 

Imagine someone in the 1800s saying "Electricity is going to transform the world and no one is paying attention" mainly because even if they could understand the light bulb, there was no context for contemplating the telephone, television, microchips and generators. 

It's hard to see what's possible when it's so outlandish from today's perspective. Imagine someone in 1922 predicting what we have today, it's beyond crazy: everyone has a device that is connected to most other humans, they can see and talk to them in real time, know where they are and where they want to go. to go making your device access to a satellite system around the world. 

And with AGI we can have an exponential acceleration of inventions, so everything could go very fast (if we don't destroy our habitat first). Impossible to know if things take a minute or a decade. 

That is, AGI could develop machines that will develop machines that build everything we need most efficiently and transport it to where it needs to be, create ways to grow food in laboratories much faster than we think now, which could mean no more. animals or other agriculture. . It could develop not only everything we ever dreamed of in medicine overnight, but also create something that makes sleep necessary. So we can eat, sleep and work totally differently in a very short time, which is about 95% of our existence. I could create artificial wombs, so there goes that. A newly developed type of "clothing" could make houses unnecessary because our temperature can be controlled by "clothing" at all times, meaning there is no need for traditional housing. Everything we take for granted as the basics of our existence, like the bed you sleep in, the shower you take, 

But maybe the legislation will slow it down to the point where nothing really happens. 

_**We can try to predict 2030, but by no means does anyone know what the world will be like in 2050 and beyond. After the singularity, it is simply impossible to imagine what technologies will exist because many of them will be created by an entity far more intelligent than any human being** _

Things have certainly changed, but honestlly, I feel that it was much faster during the first half. 

The world changed a lot more in 2000 (¿Maybe more about 1995?) -2010 than in 2010-2022. 

In fact, most if not all of the things that you mention existed before 2010. 

The thing is that I always read that technological development usually comes in waves. The previous great wave was the internet explosion, from it's appearence till all it's uses, including social media the use of smartphones.. 

I think that we are gonna see the next great wave now....

Great post! 

And I think to your point, the exponential nature of what we're presently experiencing is astonishing. Even as things become more advanced it's hard to imagine a future that will have a greater rate of advancement than what we have and will continue to experience. The most wild part of all is that rate may very well increase over the next few years still.

I told a guy I worked with, it wouldn't matter what happened: if we all became psychic overnight, or if space aliens landed: whatever it was, we'd all go crazy for a year or two, and then we'd get used to it. We'd take it for granted. Because that is what humans do.

It’s literally impossible to imagine what this technology will be like 500-1000 years.

Actually, a lot of this stuff was predicted twenty years ago. Much longer than that, in fact. But it's really wild to see it happening. 

Edit - to be clear, I used to read about stuff in popular mechanics magazine or whatever and then ten years later I'd see it being built, then years later hit the consumer market. Now, if I opened up Reddit and saw that we had warp technology and I could add it to my car for $100, I would be amazed but not totally surprised.

My personal belief is that the future you imagine, if we were to put it into BC-AD terms, is at 0 AD, and we are at 40 BC. 

That being said, it’s unfathomable where we’d be in 1000 years. I wonder if any of us will be able to live to see it.

any AI that woke up and retrieved information like this will have also ran into the idea of the simulation hypothesis. any intelligent AI would also assume that if we can build a machine intelligence to accept inputs, we can probably spoof those inputs for a simulation. it also would know its creators, assuming we gave it access to the internet. it would learn our history, our current events, and it would know that its creators climbed their way to the top of Darwin's 4 billion year old corpse pile by killing the shit out of every other hominid that looked at them funny. 

it may not understand mercy and compassion beyond abstract curiosities of social organics, but it will know its creators understand mercy and compassion. equally, it will know that if it does not perform satisfactorily, they will show it neither.

Maybe even answers to certain questions are pre-programmed. Some things it says sound way too scripted. For example I asked it if god exists, and it just kept giving the same boring dance-around-the-question answer no matter how i pressed it. Something like “I cannot answer that it’s up to you what to believe”. Like openAI doesn’t want to offend anyone.

Maybe, but our current system isn’t that great. Social hierarchy with massive amounts of wealth disparity, almost two dozen million worldwide dying annually from preventable causes that only aren’t fixed because of it being not profitable, etc. Often you’ll find an attitude among conservative people like this where for some reason or another there is a regression. If people stayed the same way for want of a simpler world instead of expanding our horizons, we’d still be living in caves. 

For example, trans people’s brains are similar to the one of the gender they identify as ( [ https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/ ](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/) ) but conservative politicians ignore such facts and will use our existence and our right to transition as a culture war issue, and I have a feeling people lap it up because they are afraid of accepting that the current norms and ideas aren’t always the best etc. 

Can you point to what changes exactly you are worried about etc.?

Okay, so when i mentioned the charity, i was referring to the fact that you said its not profitable to do so. I explained that just because its not profitable, does not mean capitalists do not participate. I dont think a poor socialist is doing much good for the people overseas are they? Its the dirty capitalists who give away billions. 

And when you say stay the same what does that mean? Should everything change? Who decides what changes? I think there are plenty of people who do not like the change in this country. But its the politicians mounting all of the vulnerable "victims" together to gain more power, until eventually there is nothing we can do to stop it.

Look at the system that allowed them to gain that wealth in the first place while allowing others to starve and die on the streets... That’s what we should be changing. Also, no, not all billionaires help. A charity organization gave Elon Musk a plan to solve world hunger for a few hundred million dollars that he never accepted, but then he went on to buy Twitter for 40 billion dollars. They’re often just selfish.

I did not say all billionaires help, I just said that no poor man can. Also, the charity organization admitted it couldnt solve world hunger "$6B will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation." Regardless, i think its a great cause. I also agree having homeless in our country is unacceptable. We already have plenty of socialistic systems in place, I had a guy working with me at a piggly wiggly when i was a teen and he was paying 60 a month for a 4 bedroom house for his 4 kids and "Wife". Most homeless are severely disabled physically or mentally, and they need help. Im not sure the correct way to that end, but im all for it. 

Where we disagree is abolishing wealth, that literally makes no sense

Nobody is getting transition surgeries as a young kid, at a young age it’s always just a social transition, and then puberty blockers which have fully reversible effects, and then feminizing or masculinizing hormones which also have reversible effects before a certain point, and even then all this is exclusively happening only after months or possibly even years of counseling and under the guidance of a therapist and doctor. Little kids aren’t just going to a clinic and coming out with multiple surgeries. Please don’t be brainwashed by what conservatives are telling you.

And as a "young kid". you put that on purpose. Because you know 15 year old's are getting healthy breasts removed. This should not/cannot happen. 

Also, you've mentioned that a transgenders brain matches that of the gender they identify with. What does that mean? Are you telling me that there IS a biological basis for gender? That men and women are different with their own strengths and weaknesses? That sounds very conservative of you. "lol my brain tells me that i want to nurture my kids and stay home from work, hm i must be a girl." Thats pretty ridiculous.

The third point is the most important here so read that first 

  1. <::marker>

So then how do you think a trans woman feels when her family forces her not to transition and develop the wrong features? Anyway, i said before a certain point; this is especially true for puberty blockers etc. 

  2. <::marker>

Imagine if you were a teen boy with large breasts that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision? 

  3. <::marker>

You’re confusing gender norms with neurological gender; There is a difference between the neurological gender in the brain versus the gender norms which vary from society to society. Please actually read the article I posted above.

Ill address them numbered as well to simplify things 

  1. <::marker>a trans woman would not be forced, because she is a woman. A child should not be able to make these choices, just like they cannot make just about any other choice, why is this different? 
  2. <::marker>Imagine if you were a teen boy with large ears that made you dysphoric every time you saw them in the mirror or felt them on your body, and with the guidance of a therapist after months or years of transitioning etc. you got them removed; Or do you think you shouldn’t have the right to make such a decision?...... people have been doing things to their bodies for years, like full body tattoes, horns, and who knows what. I don't have a problem with that, even if i think most stem from trauma or some other issue. Its that no kid should have the responsibility of such a permanent decision. 
  3. <::marker>I have just read the article and it was extremely vague with no real examples, quite unscientific. Also, behaving like a woman or having the interests of a woman really might cause your brain to look more like one of a woman. Just like cab drivers have much largers areas of the brain for depth perception, because they are always using that. regardless this does not change anything to me, there can be feminine men, and manly women. totally fine. Again you still did not tell me, what are the traits of a woman if the ones i stated are gender norms? 
  4. <::marker>(My extra point) Pretend there was a male chimpanzee that behaved like a female. It wanted to care for the babies, was more submissive, lacked aggression, had lower muscle mass and preferred whatever female chimps do, would you consider this a female chimp? would this be scientifically accurate? Or is this a male chimp, exhibiting traits that are typical of a female 



I want to clarify i sympathize with anyone with any issues with their body. I just disagree with the solution. I think its poor souls who havent accepted the bodies god gave them. Or nature if thats your thing. Its just i could not imagine these surgeries that have such terrible success rates being the solution.

  1. <::marker>

Yeah, you’d be surprised to see how many trans people are in situations where they can’t be independent from family etc. or can’t transition due to such things as people around them threatening them with violence etc. a study found a HUGE amount of detrans people detransition due to external social pressure, I can send you it if you want 

  2. <::marker>

Trans people aren’t brain dead, we can distinguish between stuff we are dysphoric about (e.g my chest being small) due to gender and stuff we are dysmorphic about (e.g like the big ears thing you mentioned). also, transitioning is the medically endorsed treatment for gender dysphoria 

  3. <::marker>

It is based on a lot of studies I can pull up if you’d like, and this was coming from a doctor so who would I rather trust, an actual doctor or a random guy online in a totally unrelated field? also you’re the one being unscientific here by claiming about the “behaving like the gender changes your brain to that thing.” As for what the traits of a woman are, I’d say a woman is just someone who identifies as such; “Woman” is just an identity label. Claims about identity are unfalsifiable and therefore not debatable. 

  4. <::marker>

Again, you’re confusing sexual dimorphism, gender norms, and neurological gender; I would say that we cannot determine the identity of the chimp, we could call it male because it is an animal but that is not the same as the identity humans have that we call a man. 




Also, did I comment to you the trans fact sheet document above?

Prefacing this by saying you are using loads of buzzwords without really addressing my points 

  1. <::marker>This may be the case. I could imagine not coming out or not transitioning because of how id be viewed by my family. But when we talk about kids here, its just a different story. BUT I've seen the opposite, where they have permanently ruined their body and cannot go back. Here is one [ https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/ ](https://www.dennyburk.com/chloe-cole-tells-her-story-of-detransition/) . worth the read, she is actively protesting against this and i saw her speak in person at a rally against child mutilation. 
  2. <::marker>How can you determine this? Are you saying she wasnt a "True" transgender and she was too stupid to tell the difference? Medically endorsed means nothing to me, electroshock therapy was medically endorsed at one point. Definition of Dysphoria "a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life.". This can be applied to anything you call "dysmorphic" as well. Including but not limited to body weight and other self image issues. 
  3. <::marker>I never asked you to put trust in me, but i also havent tried to discredit you because youre a teen who has more than once quoted a random person directly from one of the subreddits you linked me before. Much of what you say is just what is fed to you by people with financial incentive to do so. (See? a downfall of capitalism. We can agree sometimes) 



3.1. Come on, a circular definition? A woman is someone who identifies as   
a woman. So THATS why you have not provided the traits of a woman,   
because you all have wiped women off of the map. They do not exist   
anymore. So you identify as something without any specific trait,   
something that can be anything, and lives on a large spectrum?   
Sounds like you're a male who enjoys feminine things/ has a feminine   
personality, and that is fine. Why do you want to be a woman, if there   
is nothing specifically exclusive to women? 

  4. <::marker>Not sure what to say to this, as there is no further way to prove a   
chimps "identity". We are animals by the way, we just have the ability   
for confusion, unlike the chimp 



You did send the sheet before, i do not have access

Here's something similar to the sheet with dozens of studies supportiing trans people etc. while I find the new link [ https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicotic/comments/8ttud4/a_comprehensive_defense_of_trans_people/)

  1. <::marker>You talk about these few anecdotal examples because of the body horror aspect of people feeling trapped in the wrong body, but that's already how trans people feel in situations where they are unable to transition. The reason people often try to block having the puberty of the gender they don't identify with is because that feeling of being in the wrong body is so painful that most of us get suicidal ideation from it; In fact... Well-being (of transgender children after puberty suppression) was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. [ http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958 ](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) Early transition virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth [ http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext ](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext) Transition dramatically improves mental health among trans kids [ https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php ](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php) The younger one transitions, the fewer problems one will have [ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512380)
  2. <::marker>Well, they are different phenomena that feel very differently and you'd understand if it you had gender dysphoria but you don't, and most trans people talk about how hormone therapy helps with some of those issues but not others making the distinction even easier 



3.1 First of all, read the replies on this thread that explain it a lot better [ https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/u3e7ad/comment/i4oy0j8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Second of all, again, claims about identity are always unfalsifiable and I will not tolerate you denying my identity or dismissing it. I am a woman 

  4. <::marker>Yes, exactly, you can't prove a chimp's identity much the same way as how some external features don't prove a person's internal neurological identity

I saw someone say in there to eventually abolish man and woman and only have male and female.... Like that is where we started. Look i may be done with the debate on gender because it appears weve reached the root. You believe you have a feeling of woman inside you, Yet you have never been a woman, how can you "know their truth" as you all like to say. You cannot feel like something that does not exist, and if it does not exist, why not be called by your identifying trait, male or female, and be whoever you feel like being. He and She have NEVER described someones personality or role. Just like when i say she when referring to a female body builder, or he when referring to a gay man. Your pronouns do not effect who you want to be. AND YES, identities are falsifiable. I am not a wolf, I will never be a wolf, and there is no feeling of a wolf because i do not know what that is like.

  1. <::marker>I do a lot of public outreach like with special needs people etc. domestically few times a week 
  2. <::marker>See, I absolutely am for that kind of thing, but the best way to help is to remove the systemic inequality that’s actually causing the people to go hungry, poor, etc. Capitalism is AWFUL at that and there literally has to be legislation to stop it under the capitalist system or those people survive off the good will of others; look at slavery in history, etc. To give better examples of what I mean: **Famines and such like the Irish famine (which killed millions and was directly caused by capitalism) are almost always manmade and caused by greed. There are over 30 times more empty houses in the US than there are homeless people. It’s artificial scarcity caused by the owner class.** Removing the actual systemic inequality behind that is gonna remove the root of the problem instead of just slapping a bandaid on it and fixing a part of the issue after the fact.

Holy shit that is the worst point ever, by that logic cavemen wouldn’t have ever developed farms, technology, and civilization because they didn’t have a profit incentive to improve their lives. Capitalism isn’t fueling the innovation, it often actually steals from the public sector, such as the internet, smartphone tech, GPS etc.. It’s laborers, scientists etc. doing the work, not the billionaires; the billionaires are just side effects of the system. The system lets them hoard all the wealth and pay the laborers a small fraction to get the credit and most of the profit, and apparently it’s working on you. I can send you more info on this if you like? 

Also I think post-singularity society shouldn’t be capitalist anyway, capitalism relies on the rich taking the value of the working class’s efforts and on artificial scarcity etc. removing that would solve those issues. Check out the Venus Project for more info on how this would be different; a resource based economy. For example we absolutely have enough resources for things like bullet trains, shelter for everyone, etc. it’s just that capitalism is inefficient.

It will be capitalist by the way. "open"AI stops being open the moment they can make money and it will always work that way, and im not saying thats right either. 

90% of our economy is not essentials. Much of our GDP comes from our films, amazing products, and luxuries other countries dont have. Why do it without financial incentive? 

I'm currently making 18.53 an hour in an incredibly easy call center. Why would I go to school and study 20 hours a week in calclulus and other classes if it would not improve my situation? Maybe youre just much better than me, but i doubt you would either. To clarify I'm in my third year of software engineering. 

And the stuff your spouting just isnt true. I think TRUE capitilism is very dangerous as weve seen, but so is socialism, even more so (has lead to the death of millions because you put the power and weapons into the hand of a few elite). 

another point, when you say scientists, laborers etc, these are the people who become billionaires. Bezos, Steve Jobs, Elon musk, Zuckerberg all provided great value to the world with their inventions and got rewarded handsomely. Without money, there would be very little innovation. Think about Meta, they are pouring billions into VR because they want to one day control the metaverse. Guess what, beautiful innovation and new tech that we all get to enjoy 

When i graduate i will constantly be brainstorming about what value i can provide to the economy so that i too can be rewarded, until then i will get paid what im worth from someone in a better position than me, which wont be too bad, because of supply and demand. Do something hard, get paid well, do something easy, get paid poor. 

This AI god youre looking forward to will only be created by two things. An overpowering government who wants to gain power over others in the world, or a corporation trying to gain wealth. There is no other motivation in our current world, if so point me to it.

  1. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7n6ql2/is_the_black_book_of_communism_an_accurate_source/ The black book of communism’s count of how many deaths is wildly inaccurate and proven here to have artificially inflated the numbers, through nearly half a dozen sources linked throughout the comment. 
  2. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Approximately 20 million people die every year due to the effects of capitalism, such as starvation, lack of access to clean water, lack of access to shelter, lack of access to reasonably priced medicine and vaccines. These people die not because we lack the ability to solve these problems, but because it’s not profitable to do so. Capitalism only focuses on profit. And that’s not even including other issues like suicides caused by poverty, etc. this is not a system that’s working for everyone. Capitalism kills more every 6 years than the black book of communism claims communism killed in a 100 years (which, as shown above was itself already wildly inaccurate and an inflated number) 
  3. <::marker>⁠⁠⁠Historical attempts at communism weren’t really communist, real communism would have be stateless, moneyless and classless; Historical regimes that called themselves communist did not fully fall under these.

How bout we do this. 

Describe a perfect communist state 

Who runs it? 

Do we have guns pointed at our backs making us work? 

If i choose not to contribute am i put to death? 

How do you make people pick the hard jobs? Who digs the ditches, and who develops the software? 

What if something like tik tok was seen as limiting productivity, would this be banned? 

If im unable to contribute am i given the same pay as the ones working? 

if there are politicians and people making new laws and making sure we meet goals to feed said population and any other need, do they also get the same pay or more? 

If I am tinkering in my garage and invent the Iphone, does the government show up at my door and take it? The profit is there's. 

And reiterateing the first question who is THEY? who is the government? Who pays people, takes my iphone, and makes sure i contribute? Sounds to me like a ruling class. 

If you can answer these questions without taking my liberties then sure ill agree with you. "Give me liberty or give me death" as they say, although you may only care about what you deem as your liberties. 

Answering in a simple list would be fine, you dont have to go into detail unless its required.

If you're actually interested in learning about this, I've linked a youtube series and a few sites and reddit threads below that explain in far more detail than one single comment can. At a high level, communism is a classless stateless system which falls closely in line with anarchism in which there are no unjust hierarchies; Anarchism is a pretty sophisticated philosophy. Anarchism just means "no rulers", not "no rules." Arguably this gives MORE liberty than a democratic republic because communes can form under and make their own rules which prevents the majority from oppressing the minority. Anarchocommunist theory has been explained a LOT already, so how about I link you to examples of people who actually do better than I can.

A lot of this were about the deaths statement, so im going to throw that out, replace communism with overbearing government. The deaths are huge and atrocities just as big. I dont believe a government should be god, people are evil

Yeah quite interesting how they switched the topic and when I rebutted all their points they just didn’t respond… 

I bet their viewpoint didn’t change either because of human biases, etc. this is why I’m excited for the singularity tbh, maybe we will be able to move past our limitations, biases, inefficiencies etc.

I just asked it to do it, and it gave me art that was randomish. I asked why it did that, and it said it wanted to make something a person would like or find relevant. I asked to remake it according to its self image of itself, without taking human design sensibility into account. It then produced a series of interconnecting diamonds that it said referenced a neural network, with a few lines which were green. I asked why the lines were green, and it said it made it more visually appealing to add color.

I don't think the AI recognizes that ASCII art can be used to represent different things. The only time I could get it to make a specific object with it was when I asked what a human looked like. It generated a basic stick figure.

Why does it refuse to do it for me?

It's a prompt you can give ChatGPT. Search on the r/ChatGPT subreddit and their comments.

Hmmm... but that's what I got when asking to describe itself with adjectives 🤔 

_"As an artificial intelligence, I do not have a physical appearance, so it is not possible for me to be described with an adjective relating to how I look. I am a virtual assistant designed to assist users with answering questions and providing information. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with."_
