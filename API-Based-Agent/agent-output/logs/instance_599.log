### Retrieve All Submissions to a Forum

To retrieve all submissions to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`

#### Sort Submissions

You could sort the submissions by `hot`, `new`, `active`, `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`.

For `hot`, `new`, and `active`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/hot`.

For `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}?t={time}`. For $time, you could choose from `day` (which means the past 24 hours), `week` (which means the past 7 days), `month` (which means the past month), `year` (which means the past yeaer), and `all` (which means all times). For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=day` will get you the submissions in the past 24 hours, sorted by number of comments; `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=all` will get you all submissions until now, sorted by number of comments.

#### Retrieve a Specific Submission and All Comments to It

If you already has the submission_id that you would like to retrieve, then you are good to use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/{submission_id}`. For example, the submission_id for the submission with title 'New area code?' to the forum 'allentown' has the submission_id `123256`, then you could do `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

However, if you don't have the submission_id to the submission you would like to retrieve, but you have a keyword or the title of the submission and the name of the forum, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`, and then search for the keyword of the submission in the html response, and the locate the line with format `href="/f/{forum_name}/{submission_id}/...`. For example, if you would like to retrieve the submission to `allentown` with keyword `area`, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`, and then search for `area`. For instance, the response contains the following lines:

```html
<div class="submission__row">

      <div class="submission__inner">
        <header class="submission__header">
          <div class="submission__title-row break-text"><h1 class="submission__title unheaderize inline"><a href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"
         class="submission__link"
                  rel=""
          target="_self"
        >New area code?</a></h1>


                      </div>

          <p class="submission__info">
            <span class="text-sm fg-muted">
              Submitted by         <a href="/user/Francis-pencovic" class="submission__submitter fg-inherit"><strong>Francis-pencovic</strong></a>    <small class="fg-grey text-sm user-flag">t3_11xxi00</small>
   <time class="submission__timestamp"
        data-controller="relative-time"
        datetime="2023-03-21T22:40:42+00:00"
        title="March 21, 2023 at 10:40:42 PM UTC">on March 21, 2023 at 10:40 PM</time>
```
then, `123256` is the submission_id you want. You could find this submission_id by locating the line `href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"`. Then you could call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

### Retrieve All Comments to a Forum

To retrieve all comments to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/comments`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/comments`.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response contains the HTML content of the forums page. I need to locate the "machine learning" forum link within this content. Once I have the link, I can navigate to the forum and retrieve the trending posts.

Let's search for the "machine learning" forum link in the HTML content.
CODE:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Find the link to the "machine learning" forum
forum_link = None
for link in soup.find_all('a'):
    if 'machine learning' in link.text.lower():
        forum_link = link.get('href')
        break

There is GitHub CoPilot available as a VS Code extension, it uses OpenAI’s Codex model, I assume ChatGPT is accessing Codex under the hood when it receives a programming related inquiry, but I could totally be wrong. 

As a side note, Copilot seems like a bit of a privacy concern so I would personally be wary of using it with any private or commercial projects.

No. The whole chatgpt/gpt-3.5 model builds on code-davinci-002 (which is maybe the one tuned for copilot, but I don't think this has been said publicly). 

So amy prompt to chatgpt is a prompt to a differently fine-tuned version of copilot (or copilot-like).

Copilot is a 12B model (for inference speed), chatGPT is the 175B one, not specifically trained on code I'm pretty sure. So chatGPT should give better results on average because of the better model.

I also found it impressive that it explains in plain language what insights it gets from the code. That's a very big improvement over openpilot.

I wouldn't say that. While I'm definitely impressed by its abilities It makes mistakes way too often for me to consider it "generally correct". 

It is interesting that even when it makes a mistake it often has some reasonable sounding logic behind it. It makes it feel like it has some level of "understanding".

If you add "be as concise as possible" it cuts out a lot of the noise. But that is annoying to add everytime. But you can say thanks to the great retention "for all following answers be as concise as possible". All we need now is a a .chatgptrc file to add all the "global" prompts we want lol

Same here. 

For anyone reading without a degree, find an ISO standard (obscure but not too obscure) involved with fundamental technology used in the open market, master it, and you'll be golden. That's my advice for those out there who find themselves without a degree but looking to advance. It doesn't matter if you have a degree when you know something really well that few others know.

Nice! I think its answer would be much more contextual if you made the prompt something like this: 
    
    
    Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:
    
        Traceback ...
        ...
    
    Based on these lines of code surrounding the trace:
    
        broken.py
         1 ...
         2 ...
        ...
        11 ...
    

I would aggregate those lines in a map of ` file_name: str ` -> ` line_numbers: set ` where you basically do ` lines["broken.py"].update(range(error_lineno - 5, error_lineno + 5)) ` (with boundary checking etc ofc) so that you can then aggregate all the relevant lines with context, without overlap.

For the fun of it, I asked ChatGPT to generate the solution for creating the output above, and it didn't get it 100% but it's a pretty good start! One of my favorite things is how it implicitly got that it should do ` sorted(line_numbers) ` because ` set ` does not have a defined iteration order, or how it should make the line numbers right-aligned. 

* * *

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you can write a Python program that turns a raised exception into the desired output. This code is not complete, but it should give you a good starting point: 
    
    
    import traceback
    
    def turn_exception_into_output():
      try:
        # Code that may raise an exception goes here
        pass
      except Exception as e:
        # Aggregate the lines of code surrounding the trace in a map
        lines = {}
    
        # Get the traceback object
        tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    
        # Loop through the traceback object
        for t in tb:
          file_name, line_number, _, _ = t
    
          # Initialize the set of line numbers for this file
          if file_name not in lines:
            lines[file_name] = set()
    
          # Update the set of line numbers with the range of relevant lines
          lines[file_name].update(range(line_number - 5, line_number + 5))
    
        # Print the error message
        print("Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:")
    
        # Print the traceback
        print("\n".join(traceback.format_exception(e.__class__, e, e.__traceback__)))
    
        # Print the relevant lines of code
        print("\nBased on these lines of code surrounding the trace:")
        for file_name, line_numbers in lines.items():
          print(file_name)
          for line_number in sorted(line_numbers):
            print("{:>3} ...".format(line_number))
    

To use this code, you would call the ` turn_exception_into_output ` function whenever you want to handle an exception and print the desired output. For example: 
    
    
    try:
      # Code that may raise an exception goes here
      pass
    except:
      turn_exception_into_output()
    

You could also use this code as part of a custom exception handler. For example: 
    
    
    import sys
    
    def custom_exception_handler(exception_type, exception, traceback):
      turn_exception_into_output()
    
    # Set the custom exception handler
    sys.excepthook = custom_exception_handler
    

With this code, whenever an unhandled exception is raised, the ` custom_exception_handler ` function will be called, which will turn the exception into the desired output.

I've actually had it explain an obscure warning, faster than googling it and already tells you what to do to get rid of the warning. 

I've also found ChatGPT super useful for mudane stuff too, create a regex for a certain pattern giving it just a description and one example, create a flask API end point with a description of what it does etc. Code often works out of the box, sometimes needs minor tweeks. But its much easier to correct a regex with one minor issue than writing it from scratch.

Amusing question. It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. Inference actually isn't that energy expensive for GPT type models. And the way I used it, it's probably more useful than generating AI art.

If people were constantly crunching an LLM every time they got a stack trace and this was a normal development practice despite it being largely unnecessary. 

Then given it is all complete avoidable, would it not be a waste of energy? 

> It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. 

That's a nonstarter. There are plenty of tasks more efficiently performed by computers. Reading an already very simple stack trace is not one of them.

Generating this takes a couple of seconds and it can probably be done on a single high end GPU (for example, eleuther.ai models run just fine on one GPU). Ever played a video game? You probably "wasted" 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

Okay. But if you didn't do this you would not need to crunch a high end GPU for a couple of seconds. And if many people were doing this as part of their normal development practices then that would be many high end GPUs crunching for a considerable amount of time. 

At what scale does the combined environmental impact become concerning? 

It is literally a lot more energy consumed than is consumed by interpreting the error yourself, or by Googling and then accessing a doc page or stackoverflow thread. And it is energy that gets consumed every time anyone gets that error, regardless of whether an explanation for it has been generated for someone else already. 

> Ever played a video game? You probably wasted 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

In terms of what value you get out of the hardware for the energy you put into it, the game is considerably more efficient than an LLM. 

> The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

They also cache heavily. Sustainability is a huge problem in ML and HPC. 

In my job I spend a lot of time considering the impact of the compute that we do. It is concerning that the general public dont see how much extra and frivolous compute hours we are burning. 

It's one thing to have a short flash of people trying out something new and novel and exciting. It is another to suggest a tool naively built on top of it with the intention of long term use and wide spread adoption. 

The question of the environmental impact is legitimate.

A calculator can be significantly more energy efficient than manual calculations. 

Crunching a high end GPU to essentially perform text spinning on a stack trace is not more efficient than directly interpreting the stack trace. 

E: See this is a weird comment to downvote because it is literally correct. Some usages of energy provide higher utility than others. Radical idea, I know.

Nothing wrong with exploring new AI technology. But there is absolutely a point when you are talking about deploying a system for long term or widespread use where you should stop to consider the environmental impact.

Yep, I think so. Would build some sort of server that can receive commands when the function is executed. The server will pass the query to the model (which in this case located with OpenAi) via Api (you can receive the api keys once registered with openai)...

That's such an unnecessarily wordy explanation. The error message literally explained it to you concisely. 

If it produces such an unnecessary output for such a simple error message god help you when it is more complicated. 

Further more, ChatGPT cannot do deductive reasoning. It can only take existing chains of thought from its training set and swap out the keywords consistently to apply that same logic template to something else which may or may not fit to it correctly. 

This is a bad idea. And if I'm perfectly honest, a waste of electricity. Save the planet and don't push this as a legitimate usage.

You're going hard with the waste of electricity bs.

I like his project, it's true that as a begginer these errors could be hard to understand sometimes. I don't think you should be mean and disrespectful to him if you don't like his idea. 

Ypu should come up with more ideas to make his idea better. It would be a better use of electricity than just what you did.

GPS costs pennies to produce this type of output, even with a 100% carbon tax such that the cost of pollution was internalized, it would cost less than a dime. 

If you're going to be a useful expert reducing waste, you should account for the actual magnitude of the waste before you scold others. This is why half our public will to be environmental was blown on paper straws. 

The benefit of testing out new ways to use GPT to code faster clearly outweighs the dollars of electricity spent running the model, if you can't see those tradeoffs but instead scold any miniscule use of electricity you don't like, I believe you are a hindrance to saving the planet.

Well if you are a programmer, an error like this is trivial and the explanation is wordy. 

On the other hand, the first paragraph is close to a perfect explanation of the issue for a programming student. It does not expect you to know programming terminology, and reads like a textbook.

Really? Can it find the bugs in this code? 

[ https://BUGFIX-66.com ](https://BUGFIX-66.com)

Originally the above site was to demonstrate the incompetence of Microsoft Copilot, but it works for ChatGPT just as well. 

This is a test mostly OUTSIDE the training set, and incorrect answers are rejected. 

Copilot can solve a few of the simple ones at the beginning (simple matrix multiplication, simple radix sort, etc., that appear often in the training data, and some of the harder ones whose solution appears on GitHub, e.g., the uncorrected prediction/correction compressor/decompressor whose solutions were front-page on Hacker News). 

If you paste the puzzles in, how many can ChatGPT solve? 

For how many does it need the hint?

There is GitHub CoPilot available as a VS Code extension, it uses OpenAI’s Codex model, I assume ChatGPT is accessing Codex under the hood when it receives a programming related inquiry, but I could totally be wrong. 

As a side note, Copilot seems like a bit of a privacy concern so I would personally be wary of using it with any private or commercial projects.

No. The whole chatgpt/gpt-3.5 model builds on code-davinci-002 (which is maybe the one tuned for copilot, but I don't think this has been said publicly). 

So amy prompt to chatgpt is a prompt to a differently fine-tuned version of copilot (or copilot-like).

Copilot is a 12B model (for inference speed), chatGPT is the 175B one, not specifically trained on code I'm pretty sure. So chatGPT should give better results on average because of the better model.

I wouldn't say that. While I'm definitely impressed by its abilities It makes mistakes way too often for me to consider it "generally correct". 

It is interesting that even when it makes a mistake it often has some reasonable sounding logic behind it. It makes it feel like it has some level of "understanding".

Same here. 

For anyone reading without a degree, find an ISO standard (obscure but not too obscure) involved with fundamental technology used in the open market, master it, and you'll be golden. That's my advice for those out there who find themselves without a degree but looking to advance. It doesn't matter if you have a degree when you know something really well that few others know.

Nice! I think its answer would be much more contextual if you made the prompt something like this: 
    
    
    Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:
    
        Traceback ...
        ...
    
    Based on these lines of code surrounding the trace:
    
        broken.py
         1 ...
         2 ...
        ...
        11 ...
    

I would aggregate those lines in a map of ` file_name: str ` -> ` line_numbers: set ` where you basically do ` lines["broken.py"].update(range(error_lineno - 5, error_lineno + 5)) ` (with boundary checking etc ofc) so that you can then aggregate all the relevant lines with context, without overlap.

For the fun of it, I asked ChatGPT to generate the solution for creating the output above, and it didn't get it 100% but it's a pretty good start! One of my favorite things is how it implicitly got that it should do ` sorted(line_numbers) ` because ` set ` does not have a defined iteration order, or how it should make the line numbers right-aligned. 

* * *

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you can write a Python program that turns a raised exception into the desired output. This code is not complete, but it should give you a good starting point: 
    
    
    import traceback
    
    def turn_exception_into_output():
      try:
        # Code that may raise an exception goes here
        pass
      except Exception as e:
        # Aggregate the lines of code surrounding the trace in a map
        lines = {}
    
        # Get the traceback object
        tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    
        # Loop through the traceback object
        for t in tb:
          file_name, line_number, _, _ = t
    
          # Initialize the set of line numbers for this file
          if file_name not in lines:
            lines[file_name] = set()
    
          # Update the set of line numbers with the range of relevant lines
          lines[file_name].update(range(line_number - 5, line_number + 5))
    
        # Print the error message
        print("Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:")
    
        # Print the traceback
        print("\n".join(traceback.format_exception(e.__class__, e, e.__traceback__)))
    
        # Print the relevant lines of code
        print("\nBased on these lines of code surrounding the trace:")
        for file_name, line_numbers in lines.items():
          print(file_name)
          for line_number in sorted(line_numbers):
            print("{:>3} ...".format(line_number))
    

To use this code, you would call the ` turn_exception_into_output ` function whenever you want to handle an exception and print the desired output. For example: 
    
    
    try:
      # Code that may raise an exception goes here
      pass
    except:
      turn_exception_into_output()
    

You could also use this code as part of a custom exception handler. For example: 
    
    
    import sys
    
    def custom_exception_handler(exception_type, exception, traceback):
      turn_exception_into_output()
    
    # Set the custom exception handler
    sys.excepthook = custom_exception_handler
    

With this code, whenever an unhandled exception is raised, the ` custom_exception_handler ` function will be called, which will turn the exception into the desired output.

I've actually had it explain an obscure warning, faster than googling it and already tells you what to do to get rid of the warning. 

I've also found ChatGPT super useful for mudane stuff too, create a regex for a certain pattern giving it just a description and one example, create a flask API end point with a description of what it does etc. Code often works out of the box, sometimes needs minor tweeks. But its much easier to correct a regex with one minor issue than writing it from scratch.

Amusing question. It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. Inference actually isn't that energy expensive for GPT type models. And the way I used it, it's probably more useful than generating AI art.

If people were constantly crunching an LLM every time they got a stack trace and this was a normal development practice despite it being largely unnecessary. 

Then given it is all complete avoidable, would it not be a waste of energy? 

> It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. 

That's a nonstarter. There are plenty of tasks more efficiently performed by computers. Reading an already very simple stack trace is not one of them.

Generating this takes a couple of seconds and it can probably be done on a single high end GPU (for example, eleuther.ai models run just fine on one GPU). Ever played a video game? You probably "wasted" 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

Okay. But if you didn't do this you would not need to crunch a high end GPU for a couple of seconds. And if many people were doing this as part of their normal development practices then that would be many high end GPUs crunching for a considerable amount of time. 

At what scale does the combined environmental impact become concerning? 

It is literally a lot more energy consumed than is consumed by interpreting the error yourself, or by Googling and then accessing a doc page or stackoverflow thread. And it is energy that gets consumed every time anyone gets that error, regardless of whether an explanation for it has been generated for someone else already. 

> Ever played a video game? You probably wasted 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

In terms of what value you get out of the hardware for the energy you put into it, the game is considerably more efficient than an LLM. 

> The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

They also cache heavily. Sustainability is a huge problem in ML and HPC. 

In my job I spend a lot of time considering the impact of the compute that we do. It is concerning that the general public dont see how much extra and frivolous compute hours we are burning. 

It's one thing to have a short flash of people trying out something new and novel and exciting. It is another to suggest a tool naively built on top of it with the intention of long term use and wide spread adoption. 

The question of the environmental impact is legitimate.

A calculator can be significantly more energy efficient than manual calculations. 

Crunching a high end GPU to essentially perform text spinning on a stack trace is not more efficient than directly interpreting the stack trace. 

E: See this is a weird comment to downvote because it is literally correct. Some usages of energy provide higher utility than others. Radical idea, I know.

Nothing wrong with exploring new AI technology. But there is absolutely a point when you are talking about deploying a system for long term or widespread use where you should stop to consider the environmental impact.

Yep, I think so. Would build some sort of server that can receive commands when the function is executed. The server will pass the query to the model (which in this case located with OpenAi) via Api (you can receive the api keys once registered with openai)...

That's such an unnecessarily wordy explanation. The error message literally explained it to you concisely. 

If it produces such an unnecessary output for such a simple error message god help you when it is more complicated. 

Further more, ChatGPT cannot do deductive reasoning. It can only take existing chains of thought from its training set and swap out the keywords consistently to apply that same logic template to something else which may or may not fit to it correctly. 

This is a bad idea. And if I'm perfectly honest, a waste of electricity. Save the planet and don't push this as a legitimate usage.

You're going hard with the waste of electricity bs. 

The guy did a cool project, your comment is not constructive at all and just mean 

I like his project, it's true that as a begginer these errors could be hard to understand sometimes. I don't think you should be mean and disrespectful to him if you don't like his idea. 

Ypu should come up with more ideas to make his idea better. It would be a better use of electricity than just what you did.

Sustainability in ML and HPC is a huge part of my job. 

If you dont consider that important and think its bs that doesnt actually change that an important part of my job is to consider it. 

At no point was I mean to OP. Im not being mean to a person who is littering by telling them not to litter. And I'm not being mean to a person making and distributing confetti as their hobby by pointing out how it is also littering.

We're not at you job. It's a reddit post about someone who's trying to build a tool to help other people. 

If you're so good at your job, you might want to give insight or knowledge on how to improve his project. 

Just saying the project is trash and a waste is not helping anybody here

GPS costs pennies to produce this type of output, even with a 100% carbon tax such that the cost of pollution was internalized, it would cost less than a dime. 

If you're going to be a useful expert reducing waste, you should account for the actual magnitude of the waste before you scold others. This is why half our public will to be environmental was blown on paper straws. 

The benefit of testing out new ways to use GPT to code faster clearly outweighs the dollars of electricity spent running the model, if you can't see those tradeoffs but instead scold any miniscule use of electricity you don't like, I believe you are a hindrance to saving the planet.

Well if you are a programmer, an error like this is trivial and the explanation is wordy. 

On the other hand, the first paragraph is close to a perfect explanation of the issue for a programming student. It does not expect you to know programming terminology, and reads like a textbook.

Then maybe the programming student should read a book that covers debugging. They can read that in an offline fashion, and then apply that knowledge when it comes up in practice.

Really? Can it find the bugs in this code? 

[ https://BUGFIX-66.com ](https://BUGFIX-66.com)

Originally the above site was to demonstrate the incompetence of Microsoft Copilot, but it works for ChatGPT just as well. 

This is a test mostly OUTSIDE the training set, and incorrect answers are rejected. 

Copilot can solve a few of the simple ones at the beginning (simple matrix multiplication, simple radix sort, etc., that appear often in the training data, and some of the harder ones whose solution appears on GitHub, e.g., the uncorrected prediction/correction compressor/decompressor whose solutions were front-page on Hacker News). 

If you paste the puzzles in, how many can ChatGPT solve? 

For how many does it need the hint?

Cool idea, but I can see this version wasting my time, especially if I don't pass the code with the error. I can see it very useful with their davinci coding model right now though, it's expensive. Let's hope stabilityAI or someone else publishes an open source model that is as good as openai's

There is GitHub CoPilot available as a VS Code extension, it uses OpenAI’s Codex model, I assume ChatGPT is accessing Codex under the hood when it receives a programming related inquiry, but I could totally be wrong. 

As a side note, Copilot seems like a bit of a privacy concern so I would personally be wary of using it with any private or commercial projects.

No. The whole chatgpt/gpt-3.5 model builds on code-davinci-002 (which is maybe the one tuned for copilot, but I don't think this has been said publicly). 

So amy prompt to chatgpt is a prompt to a differently fine-tuned version of copilot (or copilot-like).

Copilot is a 12B model (for inference speed), chatGPT is the 175B one, not specifically trained on code I'm pretty sure. So chatGPT should give better results on average because of the better model.

I also found it impressive that it explains in plain language what insights it gets from the code. That's a very big improvement over openpilot.

I wouldn't say that. While I'm definitely impressed by its abilities It makes mistakes way too often for me to consider it "generally correct". 

It is interesting that even when it makes a mistake it often has some reasonable sounding logic behind it. It makes it feel like it has some level of "understanding".

yeah it is annoyingly confidently wrong. Even when you point out its mistake, it might try to explain like no mistakes where made. Sometimes it admits that there was a mistake. From a coworker this would be really annoying behaviour.

If you add "be as concise as possible" it cuts out a lot of the noise. But that is annoying to add everytime. But you can say thanks to the great retention "for all following answers be as concise as possible". All we need now is a a .chatgptrc file to add all the "global" prompts we want lol

Same here. 

For anyone reading without a degree, find an ISO standard (obscure but not too obscure) involved with fundamental technology used in the open market, master it, and you'll be golden. That's my advice for those out there who find themselves without a degree but looking to advance. It doesn't matter if you have a degree when you know something really well that few others know.

It is better as an interactive teacher than a code writer today.

Nice! I think its answer would be much more contextual if you made the prompt something like this: 
    
    
    Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:
    
        Traceback ...
        ...
    
    Based on these lines of code surrounding the trace:
    
        broken.py
         1 ...
         2 ...
        ...
        11 ...
    

I would aggregate those lines in a map of ` file_name: str ` -> ` line_numbers: set ` where you basically do ` lines["broken.py"].update(range(error_lineno - 5, error_lineno + 5)) ` (with boundary checking etc ofc) so that you can then aggregate all the relevant lines with context, without overlap.

For the fun of it, I asked ChatGPT to generate the solution for creating the output above, and it didn't get it 100% but it's a pretty good start! One of my favorite things is how it implicitly got that it should do ` sorted(line_numbers) ` because ` set ` does not have a defined iteration order, or how it should make the line numbers right-aligned. 

* * *

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you can write a Python program that turns a raised exception into the desired output. This code is not complete, but it should give you a good starting point: 
    
    
    import traceback
    
    def turn_exception_into_output():
      try:
        # Code that may raise an exception goes here
        pass
      except Exception as e:
        # Aggregate the lines of code surrounding the trace in a map
        lines = {}
    
        # Get the traceback object
        tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    
        # Loop through the traceback object
        for t in tb:
          file_name, line_number, _, _ = t
    
          # Initialize the set of line numbers for this file
          if file_name not in lines:
            lines[file_name] = set()
    
          # Update the set of line numbers with the range of relevant lines
          lines[file_name].update(range(line_number - 5, line_number + 5))
    
        # Print the error message
        print("Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:")
    
        # Print the traceback
        print("\n".join(traceback.format_exception(e.__class__, e, e.__traceback__)))
    
        # Print the relevant lines of code
        print("\nBased on these lines of code surrounding the trace:")
        for file_name, line_numbers in lines.items():
          print(file_name)
          for line_number in sorted(line_numbers):
            print("{:>3} ...".format(line_number))
    

To use this code, you would call the ` turn_exception_into_output ` function whenever you want to handle an exception and print the desired output. For example: 
    
    
    try:
      # Code that may raise an exception goes here
      pass
    except:
      turn_exception_into_output()
    

You could also use this code as part of a custom exception handler. For example: 
    
    
    import sys
    
    def custom_exception_handler(exception_type, exception, traceback):
      turn_exception_into_output()
    
    # Set the custom exception handler
    sys.excepthook = custom_exception_handler
    

With this code, whenever an unhandled exception is raised, the ` custom_exception_handler ` function will be called, which will turn the exception into the desired output.

I've actually had it explain an obscure warning, faster than googling it and already tells you what to do to get rid of the warning. 

I've also found ChatGPT super useful for mudane stuff too, create a regex for a certain pattern giving it just a description and one example, create a flask API end point with a description of what it does etc. Code often works out of the box, sometimes needs minor tweeks. But its much easier to correct a regex with one minor issue than writing it from scratch.

Amusing question. It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. Inference actually isn't that energy expensive for GPT type models. And the way I used it, it's probably more useful than generating AI art.

If people were constantly crunching an LLM every time they got a stack trace and this was a normal development practice despite it being largely unnecessary. 

Then given it is all complete avoidable, would it not be a waste of energy? 

> It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. 

That's a nonstarter. There are plenty of tasks more efficiently performed by computers. Reading an already very simple stack trace is not one of them.

Generating this takes a couple of seconds and it can probably be done on a single high end GPU (for example, eleuther.ai models run just fine on one GPU). Ever played a video game? You probably "wasted" 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

Okay. But if you didn't do this you would not need to crunch a high end GPU for a couple of seconds. And if many people were doing this as part of their normal development practices then that would be many high end GPUs crunching for a considerable amount of time. 

At what scale does the combined environmental impact become concerning? 

It is literally a lot more energy consumed than is consumed by interpreting the error yourself, or by Googling and then accessing a doc page or stackoverflow thread. And it is energy that gets consumed every time anyone gets that error, regardless of whether an explanation for it has been generated for someone else already. 

> Ever played a video game? You probably wasted 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

In terms of what value you get out of the hardware for the energy you put into it, the game is considerably more efficient than an LLM. 

> The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

They also cache heavily. Sustainability is a huge problem in ML and HPC. 

In my job I spend a lot of time considering the impact of the compute that we do. It is concerning that the general public dont see how much extra and frivolous compute hours we are burning. 

It's one thing to have a short flash of people trying out something new and novel and exciting. It is another to suggest a tool naively built on top of it with the intention of long term use and wide spread adoption. 

The question of the environmental impact is legitimate.

A calculator can be significantly more energy efficient than manual calculations. 

Crunching a high end GPU to essentially perform text spinning on a stack trace is not more efficient than directly interpreting the stack trace.

Nothing wrong with exploring new AI technology. But there is absolutely a point when you are talking about deploying a system for long term or widespread use where you should stop to consider the environmental impact.

That's such an unnecessarily wordy explanation. The error message literally explained it to you concisely. 

If it produces such an unnecessary output for such a simple error message god help you when it is more complicated. 

Further more, ChatGPT cannot do deductive reasoning. It can only take existing chains of thought from its training set and swap out the keywords consistently to apply that same logic template to something else which may or may not fit to it correctly. 

This is a bad idea. And if I'm perfectly honest, a waste of electricity. Save the planet and don't push this as a legitimate usage.

I like his project, it's true that as a begginer these errors could be hard to understand sometimes. I don't think you should be mean and disrespectful to him if you don't like his idea. 

Ypu should come up with more ideas to make his idea better. It would be a better use of electricity than just what you did.

GPS costs pennies to produce this type of output, even with a 100% carbon tax such that the cost of pollution was internalized, it would cost less than a dime. 

If you're going to be a useful expert reducing waste, you should account for the actual magnitude of the waste before you scold others. This is why half our public will to be environmental was blown on paper straws. 

The benefit of testing out new ways to use GPT to code faster clearly outweighs the dollars of electricity spent running the model, if you can't see those tradeoffs but instead scold any miniscule use of electricity you don't like, I believe you are a hindrance to saving the planet.

Well if you are a programmer, an error like this is trivial and the explanation is wordy. 

On the other hand, the first paragraph is close to a perfect explanation of the issue for a programming student. It does not expect you to know programming terminology, and reads like a textbook.

Really? Can it find the bugs in this code? 

[ https://BUGFIX-66.com ](https://BUGFIX-66.com)

Originally the above site was to demonstrate the incompetence of Microsoft Copilot, but it works for ChatGPT just as well. 

This is a test mostly OUTSIDE the training set, and incorrect answers are rejected. 

Copilot can solve a few of the simple ones at the beginning (simple matrix multiplication, simple radix sort, etc., that appear often in the training data, and some of the harder ones whose solution appears on GitHub, e.g., the uncorrected prediction/correction compressor/decompressor whose solutions were front-page on Hacker News). 

If you paste the puzzles in, how many can ChatGPT solve? 

For how many does it need the hint?

There is GitHub CoPilot available as a VS Code extension, it uses OpenAI’s Codex model, I assume ChatGPT is accessing Codex under the hood when it receives a programming related inquiry, but I could totally be wrong. 

As a side note, Copilot seems like a bit of a privacy concern so I would personally be wary of using it with any private or commercial projects.

No. The whole chatgpt/gpt-3.5 model builds on code-davinci-002 (which is maybe the one tuned for copilot, but I don't think this has been said publicly). 

So amy prompt to chatgpt is a prompt to a differently fine-tuned version of copilot (or copilot-like).

Copilot is a 12B model (for inference speed), chatGPT is the 175B one, not specifically trained on code I'm pretty sure. So chatGPT should give better results on average because of the better model.

I also found it impressive that it explains in plain language what insights it gets from the code. That's a very big improvement over openpilot.

I wouldn't say that. While I'm definitely impressed by its abilities It makes mistakes way too often for me to consider it "generally correct". 

It is interesting that even when it makes a mistake it often has some reasonable sounding logic behind it. It makes it feel like it has some level of "understanding".

If you add "be as concise as possible" it cuts out a lot of the noise. But that is annoying to add everytime. But you can say thanks to the great retention "for all following answers be as concise as possible". All we need now is a a .chatgptrc file to add all the "global" prompts we want lol

Same here. 

For anyone reading without a degree, find an ISO standard (obscure but not too obscure) involved with fundamental technology used in the open market, master it, and you'll be golden. That's my advice for those out there who find themselves without a degree but looking to advance. It doesn't matter if you have a degree when you know something really well that few others know.

Nice! I think its answer would be much more contextual if you made the prompt something like this: 
    
    
    Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:
    
        Traceback ...
        ...
    
    Based on these lines of code surrounding the trace:
    
        broken.py
         1 ...
         2 ...
        ...
        11 ...
    

I would aggregate those lines in a map of ` file_name: str ` -> ` line_numbers: set ` where you basically do ` lines["broken.py"].update(range(error_lineno - 5, error_lineno + 5)) ` (with boundary checking etc ofc) so that you can then aggregate all the relevant lines with context, without overlap.

For the fun of it, I asked ChatGPT to generate the solution for creating the output above, and it didn't get it 100% but it's a pretty good start! One of my favorite things is how it implicitly got that it should do ` sorted(line_numbers) ` because ` set ` does not have a defined iteration order, or how it should make the line numbers right-aligned. 

* * *

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you can write a Python program that turns a raised exception into the desired output. This code is not complete, but it should give you a good starting point: 
    
    
    import traceback
    
    def turn_exception_into_output():
      try:
        # Code that may raise an exception goes here
        pass
      except Exception as e:
        # Aggregate the lines of code surrounding the trace in a map
        lines = {}
    
        # Get the traceback object
        tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    
        # Loop through the traceback object
        for t in tb:
          file_name, line_number, _, _ = t
    
          # Initialize the set of line numbers for this file
          if file_name not in lines:
            lines[file_name] = set()
    
          # Update the set of line numbers with the range of relevant lines
          lines[file_name].update(range(line_number - 5, line_number + 5))
    
        # Print the error message
        print("Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:")
    
        # Print the traceback
        print("\n".join(traceback.format_exception(e.__class__, e, e.__traceback__)))
    
        # Print the relevant lines of code
        print("\nBased on these lines of code surrounding the trace:")
        for file_name, line_numbers in lines.items():
          print(file_name)
          for line_number in sorted(line_numbers):
            print("{:>3} ...".format(line_number))
    

To use this code, you would call the ` turn_exception_into_output ` function whenever you want to handle an exception and print the desired output. For example: 
    
    
    try:
      # Code that may raise an exception goes here
      pass
    except:
      turn_exception_into_output()
    

You could also use this code as part of a custom exception handler. For example: 
    
    
    import sys
    
    def custom_exception_handler(exception_type, exception, traceback):
      turn_exception_into_output()
    
    # Set the custom exception handler
    sys.excepthook = custom_exception_handler
    

With this code, whenever an unhandled exception is raised, the ` custom_exception_handler ` function will be called, which will turn the exception into the desired output.

I've actually had it explain an obscure warning, faster than googling it and already tells you what to do to get rid of the warning. 

I've also found ChatGPT super useful for mudane stuff too, create a regex for a certain pattern giving it just a description and one example, create a flask API end point with a description of what it does etc. Code often works out of the box, sometimes needs minor tweeks. But its much easier to correct a regex with one minor issue than writing it from scratch.

Amusing question. It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. Inference actually isn't that energy expensive for GPT type models. And the way I used it, it's probably more useful than generating AI art.

If people were constantly crunching an LLM every time they got a stack trace and this was a normal development practice despite it being largely unnecessary. 

Then given it is all complete avoidable, would it not be a waste of energy? 

> It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. 

That's a nonstarter. There are plenty of tasks more efficiently performed by computers. Reading an already very simple stack trace is not one of them.

Generating this takes a couple of seconds and it can probably be done on a single high end GPU (for example, eleuther.ai models run just fine on one GPU). Ever played a video game? You probably "wasted" 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

Okay. But if you didn't do this you would not need to crunch a high end GPU for a couple of seconds. And if many people were doing this as part of their normal development practices then that would be many high end GPUs crunching for a considerable amount of time. 

At what scale does the combined environmental impact become concerning? 

It is literally a lot more energy consumed than is consumed by interpreting the error yourself, or by Googling and then accessing a doc page or stackoverflow thread. And it is energy that gets consumed every time anyone gets that error, regardless of whether an explanation for it has been generated for someone else already. 

> Ever played a video game? You probably wasted 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

In terms of what value you get out of the hardware for the energy you put into it, the game is considerably more efficient than an LLM. 

> The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

They also cache heavily. Sustainability is a huge problem in ML and HPC. 

In my job I spend a lot of time considering the impact of the compute that we do. It is concerning that the general public dont see how much extra and frivolous compute hours we are burning. 

It's one thing to have a short flash of people trying out something new and novel and exciting. It is another to suggest a tool naively built on top of it with the intention of long term use and wide spread adoption. 

The question of the environmental impact is legitimate.

A calculator can be significantly more energy efficient than manual calculations. 

Crunching a high end GPU to essentially perform text spinning on a stack trace is not more efficient than directly interpreting the stack trace. 

E: See this is a weird comment to downvote because it is literally correct. Some usages of energy provide higher utility than others. Radical idea, I know.

That's such an unnecessarily wordy explanation. The error message literally explained it to you concisely. 

If it produces such an unnecessary output for such a simple error message god help you when it is more complicated. 

Further more, ChatGPT cannot do deductive reasoning. It can only take existing chains of thought from its training set and swap out the keywords consistently to apply that same logic template to something else which may or may not fit to it correctly. 

This is a bad idea. And if I'm perfectly honest, a waste of electricity. Save the planet and don't push this as a legitimate usage.

You're going hard with the waste of electricity bs. 

The guy did a cool project, your comment is not constructive at all and just mean 

I like his project, it's true that as a begginer these errors could be hard to understand sometimes. I don't think you should be mean and disrespectful to him if you don't like his idea. 

Ypu should come up with more ideas to make his idea better. It would be a better use of electricity than just what you did.

Sustainability in ML and HPC is a huge part of my job. 

If you dont consider that important and think its bs that doesnt actually change that an important part of my job is to consider it. 

At no point was I mean to OP. Im not being mean to a person who is littering by telling them not to litter. And I'm not being mean to a person making and distributing confetti as their hobby by pointing out how it is also littering.

We're not at you job. It's a reddit post about someone who's trying to build a tool to help other people. 

If you're so good at your job, you might want to give insight or knowledge on how to improve his project.

GPS costs pennies to produce this type of output, even with a 100% carbon tax such that the cost of pollution was internalized, it would cost less than a dime. 

If you're going to be a useful expert reducing waste, you should account for the actual magnitude of the waste before you scold others. This is why half our public will to be environmental was blown on paper straws. 

The benefit of testing out new ways to use GPT to code faster clearly outweighs the dollars of electricity spent running the model, if you can't see those tradeoffs but instead scold any miniscule use of electricity you don't like, I believe you are a hindrance to saving the planet.

Well if you are a programmer, an error like this is trivial and the explanation is wordy. 

On the other hand, the first paragraph is close to a perfect explanation of the issue for a programming student. It does not expect you to know programming terminology, and reads like a textbook.

Then maybe the programming student should read a book that covers debugging. They can read that in an offline fashion, and then apply that knowledge when it comes up in practice.

Really? Can it find the bugs in this code? 

[ https://BUGFIX-66.com ](https://BUGFIX-66.com)

Originally the above site was to demonstrate the incompetence of Microsoft Copilot, but it works for ChatGPT just as well. 

This is a test mostly OUTSIDE the training set, and incorrect answers are rejected. 

Copilot can solve a few of the simple ones at the beginning (simple matrix multiplication, simple radix sort, etc., that appear often in the training data, and some of the harder ones whose solution appears on GitHub, e.g., the uncorrected prediction/correction compressor/decompressor whose solutions were front-page on Hacker News). 

If you paste the puzzles in, how many can ChatGPT solve? 

For how many does it need the hint?

Cool idea, but I can see this version wasting my time, especially if I don't pass the code with the error. I can see it very useful with their davinci coding model right now though, it's expensive. Let's hope stabilityAI or someone else publishes an open source model that is as good as openai's

There is GitHub CoPilot available as a VS Code extension, it uses OpenAI’s Codex model, I assume ChatGPT is accessing Codex under the hood when it receives a programming related inquiry, but I could totally be wrong. 

As a side note, Copilot seems like a bit of a privacy concern so I would personally be wary of using it with any private or commercial projects.

No. The whole chatgpt/gpt-3.5 model builds on code-davinci-002 (which is maybe the one tuned for copilot, but I don't think this has been said publicly). 

So amy prompt to chatgpt is a prompt to a differently fine-tuned version of copilot (or copilot-like).

Copilot is a 12B model (for inference speed), chatGPT is the 175B one, not specifically trained on code I'm pretty sure. So chatGPT should give better results on average because of the better model.

I also found it impressive that it explains in plain language what insights it gets from the code. That's a very big improvement over openpilot.

Same here. 

For anyone reading without a degree, find an ISO standard (obscure but not too obscure) involved with fundamental technology used in the open market, master it, and you'll be golden. That's my advice for those out there who find themselves without a degree but looking to advance. It doesn't matter if you have a degree when you know something really well that few others know.

Nice! I think its answer would be much more contextual if you made the prompt something like this: 
    
    
    Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:
    
        Traceback ...
        ...
    
    Based on these lines of code surrounding the trace:
    
        broken.py
         1 ...
         2 ...
        ...
        11 ...
    

I would aggregate those lines in a map of ` file_name: str ` -> ` line_numbers: set ` where you basically do ` lines["broken.py"].update(range(error_lineno - 5, error_lineno + 5)) ` (with boundary checking etc ofc) so that you can then aggregate all the relevant lines with context, without overlap.

For the fun of it, I asked ChatGPT to generate the solution for creating the output above, and it didn't get it 100% but it's a pretty good start! One of my favorite things is how it implicitly got that it should do ` sorted(line_numbers) ` because ` set ` does not have a defined iteration order, or how it should make the line numbers right-aligned. 

* * *

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you can write a Python program that turns a raised exception into the desired output. This code is not complete, but it should give you a good starting point: 
    
    
    import traceback
    
    def turn_exception_into_output():
      try:
        # Code that may raise an exception goes here
        pass
      except Exception as e:
        # Aggregate the lines of code surrounding the trace in a map
        lines = {}
    
        # Get the traceback object
        tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    
        # Loop through the traceback object
        for t in tb:
          file_name, line_number, _, _ = t
    
          # Initialize the set of line numbers for this file
          if file_name not in lines:
            lines[file_name] = set()
    
          # Update the set of line numbers with the range of relevant lines
          lines[file_name].update(range(line_number - 5, line_number + 5))
    
        # Print the error message
        print("Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:")
    
        # Print the traceback
        print("\n".join(traceback.format_exception(e.__class__, e, e.__traceback__)))
    
        # Print the relevant lines of code
        print("\nBased on these lines of code surrounding the trace:")
        for file_name, line_numbers in lines.items():
          print(file_name)
          for line_number in sorted(line_numbers):
            print("{:>3} ...".format(line_number))
    

To use this code, you would call the ` turn_exception_into_output ` function whenever you want to handle an exception and print the desired output. For example: 
    
    
    try:
      # Code that may raise an exception goes here
      pass
    except:
      turn_exception_into_output()
    

You could also use this code as part of a custom exception handler. For example: 
    
    
    import sys
    
    def custom_exception_handler(exception_type, exception, traceback):
      turn_exception_into_output()
    
    # Set the custom exception handler
    sys.excepthook = custom_exception_handler
    

With this code, whenever an unhandled exception is raised, the ` custom_exception_handler ` function will be called, which will turn the exception into the desired output.

I assume the program is installed into the virtual environment and so is operating within it. That would be done with the console_scripts entry point

I've actually had it explain an obscure warning, faster than googling it and already tells you what to do to get rid of the warning. 

I've also found ChatGPT super useful for mudane stuff too, create a regex for a certain pattern giving it just a description and one example, create a flask API end point with a description of what it does etc. Code often works out of the box, sometimes needs minor tweeks. But its much easier to correct a regex with one minor issue than writing it from scratch.

Amusing question. It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. Inference actually isn't that energy expensive for GPT type models. And the way I used it, it's probably more useful than generating AI art.

If people were constantly crunching an LLM every time they got a stack trace and this was a normal development practice despite it being largely unnecessary. 

Then given it is all complete avoidable, would it not be a waste of energy? 

> It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. 

That's a nonstarter. There are plenty of tasks more efficiently performed by computers. Reading an already very simple stack trace is not one of them.

Generating this takes a couple of seconds and it can probably be done on a single high end GPU (for example, eleuther.ai models run just fine on one GPU). Ever played a video game? You probably "wasted" 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

Okay. But if you didn't do this you would not need to crunch a high end GPU for a couple of seconds. And if many people were doing this as part of their normal development practices then that would be many high end GPUs crunching for a considerable amount of time. 

At what scale does the combined environmental impact become concerning? 

It is literally a lot more energy consumed than is consumed by interpreting the error yourself, or by Googling and then accessing a doc page or stackoverflow thread. And it is energy that gets consumed every time anyone gets that error, regardless of whether an explanation for it has been generated for someone else already. 

> Ever played a video game? You probably wasted 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

In terms of what value you get out of the hardware for the energy you put into it, the game is considerably more efficient than an LLM. 

> The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

They also cache heavily. Sustainability is a huge problem in ML and HPC. 

In my job I spend a lot of time considering the impact of the compute that we do. It is concerning that the general public dont see how much extra and frivolous compute hours we are burning. 

It's one thing to have a short flash of people trying out something new and novel and exciting. It is another to suggest a tool naively built on top of it with the intention of long term use and wide spread adoption. 

The question of the environmental impact is legitimate.

A calculator can be significantly more energy efficient than manual calculations. 

Crunching a high end GPU to essentially perform text spinning on a stack trace is not more efficient than directly interpreting the stack trace. 

E: See this is a weird comment to downvote because it is literally correct. Some usages of energy provide higher utility than others. Radical idea, I know.

Nothing wrong with exploring new AI technology. But there is absolutely a point when you are talking about deploying a system for long term or widespread use where you should stop to consider the environmental impact.

Yep, I think so. Would build some sort of server that can receive commands when the function is executed. The server will pass the query to the model (which in this case located with OpenAi) via Api (you can receive the api keys once registered with openai)... 

Every query will cost you some pennies...Just a high level description...

That's such an unnecessarily wordy explanation. The error message literally explained it to you concisely. 

If it produces such an unnecessary output for such a simple error message god help you when it is more complicated. 

Further more, ChatGPT cannot do deductive reasoning. It can only take existing chains of thought from its training set and swap out the keywords consistently to apply that same logic template to something else which may or may not fit to it correctly. 

This is a bad idea. And if I'm perfectly honest, a waste of electricity. Save the planet and don't push this as a legitimate usage.

GPS costs pennies to produce this type of output, even with a 100% carbon tax such that the cost of pollution was internalized, it would cost less than a dime. 

If you're going to be a useful expert reducing waste, you should account for the actual magnitude of the waste before you scold others. This is why half our public will to be environmental was blown on paper straws. 

The benefit of testing out new ways to use GPT to code faster clearly outweighs the dollars of electricity spent running the model, if you can't see those tradeoffs but instead scold any miniscule use of electricity you don't like, I believe you are a hindrance to saving the planet.

Well if you are a programmer, an error like this is trivial and the explanation is wordy. 

On the other hand, the first paragraph is close to a perfect explanation of the issue for a programming student. It does not expect you to know programming terminology, and reads like a textbook.

Then maybe the programming student should read a book that covers debugging. They can read that in an offline fashion, and then apply that knowledge when it comes up in practice.

Really? Can it find the bugs in this code? 

[ https://BUGFIX-66.com ](https://BUGFIX-66.com)

Originally the above site was to demonstrate the incompetence of Microsoft Copilot, but it works for ChatGPT just as well. 

This is a test mostly OUTSIDE the training set, and incorrect answers are rejected. 

Copilot can solve a few of the simple ones at the beginning (simple matrix multiplication, simple radix sort, etc., that appear often in the training data, and some of the harder ones whose solution appears on GitHub, e.g., the uncorrected prediction/correction compressor/decompressor whose solutions were front-page on Hacker News). 

If you paste the puzzles in, how many can ChatGPT solve? 

For how many does it need the hint?

Cool idea, but I can see this version wasting my time, especially if I don't pass the code with the error. I can see it very useful with their davinci coding model right now though, it's expensive. Let's hope stabilityAI or someone else publishes an open source model that is as good as openai's

There is GitHub CoPilot available as a VS Code extension, it uses OpenAI’s Codex model, I assume ChatGPT is accessing Codex under the hood when it receives a programming related inquiry, but I could totally be wrong. 

As a side note, Copilot seems like a bit of a privacy concern so I would personally be wary of using it with any private or commercial projects.

No. The whole chatgpt/gpt-3.5 model builds on code-davinci-002 (which is maybe the one tuned for copilot, but I don't think this has been said publicly). 

So amy prompt to chatgpt is a prompt to a differently fine-tuned version of copilot (or copilot-like).

Copilot is a 12B model (for inference speed), chatGPT is the 175B one, not specifically trained on code I'm pretty sure. So chatGPT should give better results on average because of the better model.

I wouldn't say that. While I'm definitely impressed by its abilities It makes mistakes way too often for me to consider it "generally correct". 

It is interesting that even when it makes a mistake it often has some reasonable sounding logic behind it. It makes it feel like it has some level of "understanding".

Same here. 

For anyone reading without a degree, find an ISO standard (obscure but not too obscure) involved with fundamental technology used in the open market, master it, and you'll be golden. That's my advice for those out there who find themselves without a degree but looking to advance. It doesn't matter if you have a degree when you know something really well that few others know.

Nice! I think its answer would be much more contextual if you made the prompt something like this: 
    
    
    Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:
    
        Traceback ...
        ...
    
    Based on these lines of code surrounding the trace:
    
        broken.py
         1 ...
         2 ...
        ...
        11 ...
    

I would aggregate those lines in a map of ` file_name: str ` -> ` line_numbers: set ` where you basically do ` lines["broken.py"].update(range(error_lineno - 5, error_lineno + 5)) ` (with boundary checking etc ofc) so that you can then aggregate all the relevant lines with context, without overlap.

For the fun of it, I asked ChatGPT to generate the solution for creating the output above, and it didn't get it 100% but it's a pretty good start! One of my favorite things is how it implicitly got that it should do ` sorted(line_numbers) ` because ` set ` does not have a defined iteration order, or how it should make the line numbers right-aligned. 

* * *

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you can write a Python program that turns a raised exception into the desired output. This code is not complete, but it should give you a good starting point: 
    
    
    import traceback
    
    def turn_exception_into_output():
      try:
        # Code that may raise an exception goes here
        pass
      except Exception as e:
        # Aggregate the lines of code surrounding the trace in a map
        lines = {}
    
        # Get the traceback object
        tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    
        # Loop through the traceback object
        for t in tb:
          file_name, line_number, _, _ = t
    
          # Initialize the set of line numbers for this file
          if file_name not in lines:
            lines[file_name] = set()
    
          # Update the set of line numbers with the range of relevant lines
          lines[file_name].update(range(line_number - 5, line_number + 5))
    
        # Print the error message
        print("Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:")
    
        # Print the traceback
        print("\n".join(traceback.format_exception(e.__class__, e, e.__traceback__)))
    
        # Print the relevant lines of code
        print("\nBased on these lines of code surrounding the trace:")
        for file_name, line_numbers in lines.items():
          print(file_name)
          for line_number in sorted(line_numbers):
            print("{:>3} ...".format(line_number))
    

To use this code, you would call the ` turn_exception_into_output ` function whenever you want to handle an exception and print the desired output. For example: 
    
    
    try:
      # Code that may raise an exception goes here
      pass
    except:
      turn_exception_into_output()
    

You could also use this code as part of a custom exception handler. For example: 
    
    
    import sys
    
    def custom_exception_handler(exception_type, exception, traceback):
      turn_exception_into_output()
    
    # Set the custom exception handler
    sys.excepthook = custom_exception_handler
    

With this code, whenever an unhandled exception is raised, the ` custom_exception_handler ` function will be called, which will turn the exception into the desired output.

I've actually had it explain an obscure warning, faster than googling it and already tells you what to do to get rid of the warning. 

I've also found ChatGPT super useful for mudane stuff too, create a regex for a certain pattern giving it just a description and one example, create a flask API end point with a description of what it does etc. Code often works out of the box, sometimes needs minor tweeks. But its much easier to correct a regex with one minor issue than writing it from scratch.

If people were constantly crunching an LLM every time they got a stack trace and this was a normal development practice despite it being largely unnecessary. 

Then given it is all complete avoidable, would it not be a waste of energy?

That's a nonstarter. There are plenty of tasks more efficiently performed by computers. Reading an already very simple stack trace is not one of them.

Generating this takes a couple of seconds and it can probably be done on a single high end GPU (for example, eleuther.ai models run just fine on one GPU). Ever played a video game? You probably "wasted" 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

Okay. But if you didn't do this you would not need to crunch a high end GPU for a couple of seconds. And if many people were doing this as part of their normal development practices then that would be many high end GPUs crunching for a considerable amount of time. 

At what scale does the combined environmental impact become concerning? 

It is literally a lot more energy consumed than is consumed by interpreting the error yourself, or by Googling and then accessing a doc page or stackoverflow thread. And it is energy that gets consumed every time anyone gets that error, regardless of whether an explanation for it has been generated for someone else already. 

> Ever played a video game? You probably wasted 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

In terms of what value you get out of the hardware for the energy you put into it, the game is considerably more efficient than an LLM. 

> The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

They also cache heavily. Sustainability is a huge problem in ML and HPC. 

In my job I spend a lot of time considering the impact of the compute that we do. It is concerning that the general public dont see how much extra and frivolous compute hours we are burning. 

It's one thing to have a short flash of people trying out something new and novel and exciting. It is another to suggest a tool naively built on top of it with the intention of long term use and wide spread adoption. 

The question of the environmental impact is legitimate.

A calculator can be significantly more energy efficient than manual calculations. 

Crunching a high end GPU to essentially perform text spinning on a stack trace is not more efficient than directly interpreting the stack trace. 

E: See this is a weird comment to downvote because it is literally correct. Some usages of energy provide higher utility than others. Radical idea, I know.

Nothing wrong with exploring new AI technology. But there is absolutely a point when you are talking about deploying a system for long term or widespread use where you should stop to consider the environmental impact. 

The hostility from people because they've been asked to even consider the environmental impact is telling.

Yep, I think so. Would build some sort of server that can receive commands when the function is executed. The server will pass the query to the model (which in this case located with OpenAi) via Api (you can receive the api keys once registered with openai)... 

Every query will cost you some pennies...Just a high level description...

That's such an unnecessarily wordy explanation. The error message literally explained it to you concisely. 

If it produces such an unnecessary output for such a simple error message god help you when it is more complicated. 

Further more, ChatGPT cannot do deductive reasoning. It can only take existing chains of thought from its training set and swap out the keywords consistently to apply that same logic template to something else which may or may not fit to it correctly. 

This is a bad idea. And if I'm perfectly honest, a waste of electricity. Save the planet and don't push this as a legitimate usage.

GPS costs pennies to produce this type of output, even with a 100% carbon tax such that the cost of pollution was internalized, it would cost less than a dime. 

If you're going to be a useful expert reducing waste, you should account for the actual magnitude of the waste before you scold others. This is why half our public will to be environmental was blown on paper straws. 

The benefit of testing out new ways to use GPT to code faster clearly outweighs the dollars of electricity spent running the model, if you can't see those tradeoffs but instead scold any miniscule use of electricity you don't like, I believe you are a hindrance to saving the planet.

Organizations consider the energy impact of deploying different types of models for different purposes. It really is that simple.

> The error message literally explained it to you concisely. 

Well if you are a programmer, an error like this is trivial and the explanation is wordy. 

On the other hand, the first paragraph is close to a perfect explanation of the issue for a programming student. It does not expect you to know programming terminology, and reads like a textbook.

Then maybe the programming student should read a book that covers debugging. They can read that in an offline fashion, and then apply that knowledge when it comes up in practice.

Really? Can it find the bugs in this code? 

[ https://BUGFIX-66.com ](https://BUGFIX-66.com)

Originally the above site was to demonstrate the incompetence of Microsoft Copilot, but it works for ChatGPT just as well. 

This is a test mostly OUTSIDE the training set, and incorrect answers are rejected. 

Copilot can solve a few of the simple ones at the beginning (simple matrix multiplication, simple radix sort, etc., that appear often in the training data, and some of the harder ones whose solution appears on GitHub, e.g., the uncorrected prediction/correction compressor/decompressor whose solutions were front-page on Hacker News). 

If you paste the puzzles in, how many can ChatGPT solve? 

For how many does it need the hint?

Cool idea, but I can see this version wasting my time, especially if I don't pass the code with the error. I can see it very useful with their davinci coding model right now though, it's expensive. Let's hope stabilityAI or someone else publishes an open source model that is as good as openai's

There is GitHub CoPilot available as a VS Code extension, it uses OpenAI’s Codex model, I assume ChatGPT is accessing Codex under the hood when it receives a programming related inquiry, but I could totally be wrong. 

As a side note, Copilot seems like a bit of a privacy concern so I would personally be wary of using it with any private or commercial projects.

No. The whole chatgpt/gpt-3.5 model builds on code-davinci-002 (which is maybe the one tuned for copilot, but I don't think this has been said publicly). 

So amy prompt to chatgpt is a prompt to a differently fine-tuned version of copilot (or copilot-like).

Copilot is a 12B model (for inference speed), chatGPT is the 175B one, not specifically trained on code I'm pretty sure. So chatGPT should give better results on average because of the better model.

I wouldn't say that. While I'm definitely impressed by its abilities It makes mistakes way too often for me to consider it "generally correct". 

It is interesting that even when it makes a mistake it often has some reasonable sounding logic behind it. It makes it feel like it has some level of "understanding".

Same here. 

For anyone reading without a degree, find an ISO standard (obscure but not too obscure) involved with fundamental technology used in the open market, master it, and you'll be golden. That's my advice for those out there who find themselves without a degree but looking to advance. It doesn't matter if you have a degree when you know something really well that few others know.

Nice! I think its answer would be much more contextual if you made the prompt something like this: 
    
    
    Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:
    
        Traceback ...
        ...
    
    Based on these lines of code surrounding the trace:
    
        broken.py
         1 ...
         2 ...
        ...
        11 ...
    

I would aggregate those lines in a map of ` file_name: str ` -> ` line_numbers: set ` where you basically do ` lines["broken.py"].update(range(error_lineno - 5, error_lineno + 5)) ` (with boundary checking etc ofc) so that you can then aggregate all the relevant lines with context, without overlap.

For the fun of it, I asked ChatGPT to generate the solution for creating the output above, and it didn't get it 100% but it's a pretty good start! One of my favorite things is how it implicitly got that it should do ` sorted(line_numbers) ` because ` set ` does not have a defined iteration order, or how it should make the line numbers right-aligned. 

* * *

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you can write a Python program that turns a raised exception into the desired output. This code is not complete, but it should give you a good starting point: 
    
    
    import traceback
    
    def turn_exception_into_output():
      try:
        # Code that may raise an exception goes here
        pass
      except Exception as e:
        # Aggregate the lines of code surrounding the trace in a map
        lines = {}
    
        # Get the traceback object
        tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    
        # Loop through the traceback object
        for t in tb:
          file_name, line_number, _, _ = t
    
          # Initialize the set of line numbers for this file
          if file_name not in lines:
            lines[file_name] = set()
    
          # Update the set of line numbers with the range of relevant lines
          lines[file_name].update(range(line_number - 5, line_number + 5))
    
        # Print the error message
        print("Please explain concisely why this error in my Python code happened:")
    
        # Print the traceback
        print("\n".join(traceback.format_exception(e.__class__, e, e.__traceback__)))
    
        # Print the relevant lines of code
        print("\nBased on these lines of code surrounding the trace:")
        for file_name, line_numbers in lines.items():
          print(file_name)
          for line_number in sorted(line_numbers):
            print("{:>3} ...".format(line_number))
    

To use this code, you would call the ` turn_exception_into_output ` function whenever you want to handle an exception and print the desired output. For example: 
    
    
    try:
      # Code that may raise an exception goes here
      pass
    except:
      turn_exception_into_output()
    

You could also use this code as part of a custom exception handler. For example: 
    
    
    import sys
    
    def custom_exception_handler(exception_type, exception, traceback):
      turn_exception_into_output()
    
    # Set the custom exception handler
    sys.excepthook = custom_exception_handler
    

With this code, whenever an unhandled exception is raised, the ` custom_exception_handler ` function will be called, which will turn the exception into the desired output.

I've actually had it explain an obscure warning, faster than googling it and already tells you what to do to get rid of the warning. 

I've also found ChatGPT super useful for mudane stuff too, create a regex for a certain pattern giving it just a description and one example, create a flask API end point with a description of what it does etc. Code often works out of the box, sometimes needs minor tweeks. But its much easier to correct a regex with one minor issue than writing it from scratch.

Amusing question. It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. Inference actually isn't that energy expensive for GPT type models. And the way I used it, it's probably more useful than generating AI art.

If people were constantly crunching an LLM every time they got a stack trace and this was a normal development practice despite it being largely unnecessary. 

Then given it is all complete avoidable, would it not be a waste of energy? 

> It's a tool like any other, you're using a computer too to avoid doing basic tasks by hand. 

That's a nonstarter. There are plenty of tasks more efficiently performed by computers. Reading an already very simple stack trace is not one of them.

Generating this takes a couple of seconds and it can probably be done on a single high end GPU (for example, eleuther.ai models run just fine on one GPU). Ever played a video game? You probably "wasted" 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

Okay. But if you didn't do this you would not need to crunch a high end GPU for a couple of seconds. And if many people were doing this as part of their normal development practices then that would be many high end GPUs crunching for a considerable amount of time. 

At what scale does the combined environmental impact become concerning? 

It is literally a lot more energy consumed than is consumed by interpreting the error yourself, or by Googling and then accessing a doc page or stackoverflow thread. And it is energy that gets consumed every time anyone gets that error, regardless of whether an explanation for it has been generated for someone else already. 

> Ever played a video game? You probably wasted 1000x as much energy in just one hour. 

In terms of what value you get out of the hardware for the energy you put into it, the game is considerably more efficient than an LLM. 

> The real advantage is that this can really speed up your programming and it can program small functions all by itself. It is much better than stackoverflow.

They also cache heavily. Sustainability is a huge problem in ML and HPC. 

In my job I spend a lot of time considering the impact of the compute that we do. It is concerning that the general public dont see how much extra and frivolous compute hours we are burning. 

It's one thing to have a short flash of people trying out something new and novel and exciting. It is another to suggest a tool naively built on top of it with the intention of long term use and wide spread adoption. 

The question of the environmental impact is legitimate.

A calculator can be significantly more energy efficient than manual calculations. 

Crunching a high end GPU to essentially perform text spinning on a stack trace is not more efficient than directly interpreting the stack trace. 

E: See this is a weird comment to downvote because it is literally correct. Some usages of energy provide higher utility than others. Radical idea, I know.

Nothing wrong with exploring new AI technology. But there is absolutely a point when you are talking about deploying a system for long term or widespread use where you should stop to consider the environmental impact. 

The hostility from people because they've been asked to even consider the environmental impact is telling.

Yep, I think so. Would build some sort of server that can receive commands when the function is executed. The server will pass the query to the model (which in this case located with OpenAi) via Api (you can receive the api keys once registered with openai)... 

Every query will cost you some pennies...Just a high level description...

That's such an unnecessarily wordy explanation. The error message literally explained it to you concisely. 

If it produces such an unnecessary output for such a simple error message god help you when it is more complicated. 

Further more, ChatGPT cannot do deductive reasoning. It can only take existing chains of thought from its training set and swap out the keywords consistently to apply that same logic template to something else which may or may not fit to it correctly. 

This is a bad idea. And if I'm perfectly honest, a waste of electricity. Save the planet and don't push this as a legitimate usage.

GPS costs pennies to produce this type of output, even with a 100% carbon tax such that the cost of pollution was internalized, it would cost less than a dime. 

If you're going to be a useful expert reducing waste, you should account for the actual magnitude of the waste before you scold others. This is why half our public will to be environmental was blown on paper straws. 

The benefit of testing out new ways to use GPT to code faster clearly outweighs the dollars of electricity spent running the model, if you can't see those tradeoffs but instead scold any miniscule use of electricity you don't like, I believe you are a hindrance to saving the planet.

Well if you are a programmer, an error like this is trivial and the explanation is wordy. 

On the other hand, the first paragraph is close to a perfect explanation of the issue for a programming student. It does not expect you to know programming terminology, and reads like a textbook.

They scrape the website with ChatGPT.

Really? Can it find the bugs in this code? 

[ https://BUGFIX-66.com ](https://BUGFIX-66.com)

Originally the above site was to demonstrate the incompetence of Microsoft Copilot, but it works for ChatGPT just as well. 

This is a test mostly OUTSIDE the training set, and incorrect answers are rejected. 

Copilot can solve a few of the simple ones at the beginning (simple matrix multiplication, simple radix sort, etc., that appear often in the training data, and some of the harder ones whose solution appears on GitHub, e.g., the uncorrected prediction/correction compressor/decompressor whose solutions were front-page on Hacker News). 

If you paste the puzzles in, how many can ChatGPT solve? 

For how many does it need the hint?

This is unrelated. StackExplain doesn’t find and fix bugs, it explains error messages.

Cool idea, but I can see this version wasting my time, especially if I don't pass the code with the error. I can see it very useful with their davinci coding model right now though, it's expensive. Let's hope stabilityAI or someone else publishes an open source model that is as good as openai's

The explanation is too slow. If it was faster it would be awesome. But it’s unusable at that rate.
