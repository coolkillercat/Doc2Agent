### Retrieve All Submissions to a Forum

To retrieve all submissions to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`

#### Sort Submissions

You could sort the submissions by `hot`, `new`, `active`, `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`.

For `hot`, `new`, and `active`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/hot`.

For `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}?t={time}`. For $time, you could choose from `day` (which means the past 24 hours), `week` (which means the past 7 days), `month` (which means the past month), `year` (which means the past yeaer), and `all` (which means all times). For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=day` will get you the submissions in the past 24 hours, sorted by number of comments; `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=all` will get you all submissions until now, sorted by number of comments.

#### Retrieve a Specific Submission and All Comments to It

If you already has the submission_id that you would like to retrieve, then you are good to use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/{submission_id}`. For example, the submission_id for the submission with title 'New area code?' to the forum 'allentown' has the submission_id `123256`, then you could do `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

However, if you don't have the submission_id to the submission you would like to retrieve, but you have a keyword or the title of the submission and the name of the forum, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`, and then search for the keyword of the submission in the html response, and the locate the line with format `href="/f/{forum_name}/{submission_id}/...`. For example, if you would like to retrieve the submission to `allentown` with keyword `area`, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`, and then search for `area`. For instance, the response contains the following lines:

```html
<div class="submission__row">

      <div class="submission__inner">
        <header class="submission__header">
          <div class="submission__title-row break-text"><h1 class="submission__title unheaderize inline"><a href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"
         class="submission__link"
                  rel=""
          target="_self"
        >New area code?</a></h1>


                      </div>

          <p class="submission__info">
            <span class="text-sm fg-muted">
              Submitted by         <a href="/user/Francis-pencovic" class="submission__submitter fg-inherit"><strong>Francis-pencovic</strong></a>    <small class="fg-grey text-sm user-flag">t3_11xxi00</small>
   <time class="submission__timestamp"
        data-controller="relative-time"
        datetime="2023-03-21T22:40:42+00:00"
        title="March 21, 2023 at 10:40:42 PM UTC">on March 21, 2023 at 10:40 PM</time>
```
then, `123256` is the submission_id you want. You could find this submission_id by locating the line `href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"`. Then you could call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

### Retrieve All Comments to a Forum

Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To dislike all submissions created by RickyDontLoseThat in the subreddit "massachusetts," we need to follow these steps:

1. Retrieve all submissions in the "massachusetts" subreddit.
2. Filter the submissions to find those created by the user "RickyDontLoseThat."
3. Downvote each of these submissions.

Let's start by retrieving all submissions in the "massachusetts" subreddit.
CODE:
import requests

# Step 1: Retrieve all submissions in the "massachusetts" subreddit
subreddit_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/massachusetts"
response = requests.get(subreddit_url)
response.text
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
[Code executed successfully with no output]

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The response from the API call contains the HTML content of the "massachusetts" subreddit. We need to parse this HTML to find all submissions by the user "RickyDontLoseThat" and then downvote each of these submissions.

Let's parse the HTML content to find the submissions by "RickyDontLoseThat."
CODE:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Parse the HTML content
html_content = response.text
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

# Find all submissions by "RickyDontLoseThat"
submissions = soup.find_all('div', class_='submission__row')
ricky_submissions = []

for submission in submissions:
    submitter = submission.find('a', class_='submission__submitter')
    if submitter and submitter.text.strip() == 'RickyDontLoseThat':
        submission_id = submission.find('a', class_='submission__link')['href'].split('/')[-2]
        ricky_submissions.append(submission_id)
