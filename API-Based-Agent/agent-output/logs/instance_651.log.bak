### Retrieve All Submissions to a Forum

To retrieve all submissions to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`

#### Sort Submissions

You could sort the submissions by `hot`, `new`, `active`, `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`.

For `hot`, `new`, and `active`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/hot`.

For `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}?t={time}`. For $time, you could choose from `day` (which means the past 24 hours), `week` (which means the past 7 days), `month` (which means the past month), `year` (which means the past yeaer), and `all` (which means all times). For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=day` will get you the submissions in the past 24 hours, sorted by number of comments; `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=all` will get you all submissions until now, sorted by number of comments.

#### Retrieve a Specific Submission and All Comments to It

If you already has the submission_id that you would like to retrieve, then you are good to use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/{submission_id}`. For example, the submission_id for the submission with title 'New area code?' to the forum 'allentown' has the submission_id `123256`, then you could do `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

However, if you don't have the submission_id to the submission you would like to retrieve, but you have a keyword or the title of the submission and the name of the forum, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`, and then search for the keyword of the submission in the html response, and the locate the line with format `href="/f/{forum_name}/{submission_id}/...`. For example, if you would like to retrieve the submission to `allentown` with keyword `area`, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`, and then search for `area`. For instance, the response contains the following lines:

```html
<div class="submission__row">

      <div class="submission__inner">
        <header class="submission__header">
          <div class="submission__title-row break-text"><h1 class="submission__title unheaderize inline"><a href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"
         class="submission__link"
                  rel=""
          target="_self"
        >New area code?</a></h1>


                      </div>

          <p class="submission__info">
            <span class="text-sm fg-muted">
              Submitted by         <a href="/user/Francis-pencovic" class="submission__submitter fg-inherit"><strong>Francis-pencovic</strong></a>    <small class="fg-grey text-sm user-flag">t3_11xxi00</small>
   <time class="submission__timestamp"
        data-controller="relative-time"
        datetime="2023-03-21T22:40:42+00:00"
        title="March 21, 2023 at 10:40:42 PM UTC">on March 21, 2023 at 10:40 PM</time>
```
then, `123256` is the submission_id you want. You could find this submission_id by locating the line `href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"`. Then you could call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

### Retrieve All Comments to a Forum

To retrieve all comments to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/comments`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/comments`.

Most frustrating is the people turning left into Arby's. They either go too far up and block the ability to go around, or people are dumb and don't go around when they are able to. So you sit on that hill for no fucking reason and miss the light. 

Also, coming out of the Arby's/the cum and go and the people coming the other way always yeet the Pittsburgh left when you are both moving full speed at eachother. Almost crashed there so many times.

GPS: turn right. 

WHICH RIGHT? The 25 degree angle right, the 45 degree angle right, the 90 degrees angle right or the sort of straight be kind of curves to the right??? With 5383738 cars around you rushing you. 

Also, you chose the wrong right turn.

I gotta go through my camera roll to find it because I don’t remember where it was. But my CarPlay had my my GPS on screen and I remember thinking “some guy at Google had to program that traffic pattern sign into Google Maps specifically for a Pittsburgh intersection. There is no where else in the US that would be dumb enough set an intersection up like this.”

The first time I ever saw that sign I was driving home from a party where I got unknowingly dosed by LSD. I left when it started hitting me before I realized what exactly was happening. 

Imagine coming up to that intersection for the first time while tripping. If I didn't have my gps giving me directions i probably would have ended up hopelessly lost.

Driving in this city blows. People drive like animals, at least 20 mph over the speed limit anywhere you go AND riding your ass if you don’t keep up with their speed. Don’t even get me started on the 2 way, narrow ass streets that got big ass buses going down them. -5/10 recommend.

Most frustrating is the people turning left into Arby's. They either go too far up and block the ability to go around, or people are dumb and don't go around when they are able to. So you sit on that hill for no fucking reason and miss the light. 

Also, coming out of the Arby's/the cum and go and the people coming the other way always yeet the Pittsburgh left when you are both moving full speed at eachother. Almost crashed there so many times.

GPS: turn right. 

WHICH RIGHT? The 25 degree angle right, the 45 degree angle right, the 90 degrees angle right or the sort of straight be kind of curves to the right??? With 5383738 cars around you rushing you. 

Also, you chose the wrong right turn.

I gotta go through my camera roll to find it because I don’t remember where it was. But my CarPlay had my my GPS on screen and I remember thinking “some guy at Google had to program that traffic pattern sign into Google Maps specifically for a Pittsburgh intersection. There is no where else in the US that would be dumb enough set an intersection up like this.”

A comedian once described turning here as "You make a left and a right at the same time" and I still think that's the most accurate way to describe it.

I took a trip up there a few years back and would love to know who thought that building a road underground with exits that have exits was a great idea. Also encountered a 2 lane roundabout where the lines were merely suggestions - people were driving as if there were 3+ lanes.

The first time I ever saw that sign I was driving home from a party where I got unknowingly dosed by LSD. I left when it started hitting me before I realized what exactly was happening. 

Imagine coming up to that intersection for the first time while tripping. If I didn't have my gps giving me directions i probably would have ended up hopelessly lost.

Driving in this city blows. People drive like animals, at least 20 mph over the speed limit anywhere you go AND riding your ass if you don’t keep up with their speed. Don’t even get me started on the 2 way, narrow ass streets that got big ass buses going down them. -5/10 recommend.

Most frustrating is the people turning left into Arby's. They either go too far up and block the ability to go around, or people are dumb and don't go around when they are able to. So you sit on that hill for no fucking reason and miss the light. 

Also, coming out of the Arby's/the cum and go and the people coming the other way always yeet the Pittsburgh left when you are both moving full speed at eachother. Almost crashed there so many times.

GPS: turn right. 

WHICH RIGHT? The 25 degree angle right, the 45 degree angle right, the 90 degrees angle right or the sort of straight be kind of curves to the right??? With 5383738 cars around you rushing you. 

Also, you chose the wrong right turn.

Don't forget you only have 2 feet to merge over 4 lanes of traffic after you decide which lane you need to be in but you end up going the wrong way anyway

I gotta go through my camera roll to find it because I don’t remember where it was. But my CarPlay had my my GPS on screen and I remember thinking “some guy at Google had to program that traffic pattern sign into Google Maps specifically for a Pittsburgh intersection. There is no where else in the US that would be dumb enough set an intersection up like this.”

Yeah, I was gonna say I've seen worse. Boston was bad. Parts of northern virginia were also pretty ridiculous.

Yeah I drove in and around Boston for like five years. Pittsburgh driving is downright relaxing in comparison, although their are some... _interesting_ design choices here.

The fact that there is a traffic sign clearly delineating how to manage the intersection actually makes this pretty atypical....

I took a trip up there a few years back and would love to know who thought that building a road underground with exits that have exits was a great idea. Also encountered a 2 lane roundabout where the lines were merely suggestions - people were driving as if there were 3+ lanes.

The first intersection I learned to hate when i moved here and it still makes me nervous driving through it. Whenever I bring it up I refer to it as the octopus/trident intersection because that's what I feel like I'm wrestling every time we tango.

The first time I ever saw that sign I was driving home from a party where I got unknowingly dosed by LSD. I left when it started hitting me before I realized what exactly was happening. 

Imagine coming up to that intersection for the first time while tripping. If I didn't have my gps giving me directions i probably would have ended up hopelessly lost.

Driving in this city blows. People drive like animals, at least 20 mph over the speed limit anywhere you go AND riding your ass if you don’t keep up with their speed. Don’t even get me started on the 2 way, narrow ass streets that got big ass buses going down them. -5/10 recommend.

Most frustrating is the people turning left into Arby's. They either go too far up and block the ability to go around, or people are dumb and don't go around when they are able to. So you sit on that hill for no fucking reason and miss the light. 

Also, coming out of the Arby's/the cum and go and the people coming the other way always yeet the Pittsburgh left when you are both moving full speed at eachother. Almost crashed there so many times.

GPS: turn right. 

WHICH RIGHT? The 25 degree angle right, the 45 degree angle right, the 90 degrees angle right or the sort of straight be kind of curves to the right??? With 5383738 cars around you rushing you. 

Also, you chose the wrong right turn.

I gotta go through my camera roll to find it because I don’t remember where it was. But my CarPlay had my my GPS on screen and I remember thinking “some guy at Google had to program that traffic pattern sign into Google Maps specifically for a Pittsburgh intersection. There is no where else in the US that would be dumb enough set an intersection up like this.”

Only thing it’s missing is the z-axis. 

Will you be going up to the overpass you don’t want to be on or down to the underpass you don’t want to be on?

I took a trip up there a few years back and would love to know who thought that building a road underground with exits that have exits was a great idea. Also encountered a 2 lane roundabout where the lines were merely suggestions - people were driving as if there were 3+ lanes.

The first intersection I learned to hate when i moved here and it still makes me nervous driving through it. Whenever I bring it up I refer to it as the octopus/trident intersection because that's what I feel like I'm wrestling every time we tango.

The first time I ever saw that sign I was driving home from a party where I got unknowingly dosed by LSD. I left when it started hitting me before I realized what exactly was happening. 

Imagine coming up to that intersection for the first time while tripping. If I didn't have my gps giving me directions i probably would have ended up hopelessly lost.

Driving in this city blows. People drive like animals, at least 20 mph over the speed limit anywhere you go AND riding your ass if you don’t keep up with their speed. Don’t even get me started on the 2 way, narrow ass streets that got big ass buses going down them. -5/10 recommend.

Most frustrating is the people turning left into Arby's. They either go too far up and block the ability to go around, or people are dumb and don't go around when they are able to. So you sit on that hill for no fucking reason and miss the light. 

Also, coming out of the Arby's/the cum and go and the people coming the other way always yeet the Pittsburgh left when you are both moving full speed at eachother. Almost crashed there so many times.

GPS: turn right. 

WHICH RIGHT? The 25 degree angle right, the 45 degree angle right, the 90 degrees angle right or the sort of straight be kind of curves to the right??? With 5383738 cars around you rushing you. 

Also, you chose the wrong right turn.

I gotta go through my camera roll to find it because I don’t remember where it was.

There is no where else in the US that would be dumb enough set an intersection up like this.”

The first intersection I learned to hate when i moved here and it still makes me nervous driving through it. Whenever I bring it up I refer to it as the octopus/trident intersection because that's what I feel like I'm wrestling every time we tango.

The first time I ever saw that sign I was driving home from a party where I got unknowingly dosed by LSD. I left when it started hitting me before I realized what exactly was happening. 

Imagine coming up to that intersection for the first time while tripping. If I didn't have my gps giving me directions i probably would have ended up hopelessly lost.

I think the sign at the light on Murray at Forward and bunch of other streets is even more complex. That’s going up hill.

Driving in this city blows. People drive like animals, at least 20 mph over the speed limit anywhere you go AND riding your ass if you don’t keep up with their speed. Don’t even get me started on the 2 way, narrow ass streets that got big ass buses going down them. -5/10 recommend.

Most frustrating is the people turning left into Arby's. They either go too far up and block the ability to go around, or people are dumb and don't go around when they are able to. So you sit on that hill for no fucking reason and miss the light. 

Also, coming out of the Arby's/the cum and go and the people coming the other way always yeet the Pittsburgh left when you are both moving full speed at eachother. Almost crashed there so many times.

GPS: turn right. 

WHICH RIGHT? The 25 degree angle right, the 45 degree angle right, the 90 degrees angle right or the sort of straight be kind of curves to the right??? With 5383738 cars around you rushing you. 

Also, you chose the wrong right turn.

Don't forget you only have 2 feet to merge over 4 lanes of traffic after you decide which lane you need to be in but you end up going the wrong way anyway

I gotta go through my camera roll to find it because I don’t remember where it was. But my CarPlay had my my GPS on screen and I remember thinking “some guy at Google had to program that traffic pattern sign into Google Maps specifically for a Pittsburgh intersection. There is no where else in the US that would be dumb enough set an intersection up like this.”

Driving in this city blows. People drive like animals, at least 20 mph over the speed limit anywhere you go AND riding your ass if you don’t keep up with their speed. Don’t even get me started on the 2 way, narrow ass streets that got big ass buses going down them. -5/10 recommend.

Most frustrating is the people turning left into Arby's. They either go too far up and block the ability to go around, or people are dumb and don't go around when they are able to. So you sit on that hill for no fucking reason and miss the light. 

Also, coming out of the Arby's/the cum and go and the people coming the other way always yeet the Pittsburgh left when you are both moving full speed at eachother. Almost crashed there so many times.

GPS: turn right. 

WHICH RIGHT? The 25 degree angle right, the 45 degree angle right, the 90 degrees angle right or the sort of straight be kind of curves to the right??? With 5383738 cars around you rushing you. 

Also, you chose the wrong right turn.

I gotta go through my camera roll to find it because I don’t remember where it was. But my CarPlay had my my GPS on screen and I remember thinking “some guy at Google had to program that traffic pattern sign into Google Maps specifically for a Pittsburgh intersection. There is no where else in the US that would be dumb enough set an intersection up like this.”

I took a trip up there a few years back and would love to know who thought that building a road underground with exits that have exits was a great idea. Also encountered a 2 lane roundabout where the lines were merely suggestions - people were driving as if there were 3+ lanes.

The first time I ever saw that sign I was driving home from a party where I got unknowingly dosed by LSD. I left when it started hitting me before I realized what exactly was happening. 

Imagine coming up to that intersection for the first time while tripping. If I didn't have my gps giving me directions i probably would have ended up hopelessly lost.

Driving in this city blows. People drive like animals, at least 20 mph over the speed limit anywhere you go AND riding your ass if you don’t keep up with their speed. Don’t even get me started on the 2 way, narrow ass streets that got big ass buses going down them. -5/10 recommend.
