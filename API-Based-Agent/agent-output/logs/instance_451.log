CONTENT: Think step by step to perform the following task related to gitlab. Answer the question: ***set the homepage URL on my GitLab profile to www.byteblaze.com***
The site URL for gitlab is http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023, use this instead of the normal gitlab URL.
For API calling, use this access token: glpat-KygcYjwtD2JfA6wU4wBd
For web browsing, You should start from the URL http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023, and this webpage is already logged in and opened for you.
My *name* on gitlab is Byte Blaze; My *username* on gitlab is byteblaze; and my *user id* is 2330.

Note: Before actually using a Gitlab API call, *you should call the `get_api_documentation_gitlab` function in the `utils` module to get detailed API documentation of the API.* For example, if you want to use the API GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/repository/commits, you should first do: 
<execute_ipython>
from utils import get_api_documentation_gitlab
get_api_documentation_gitlab('GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/repository/commits')
</execute_ipython>
This will provide you with detailed descriptions of the input parameters and example output jsons.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 3:

THOUGHT: To set the homepage URL on your GitLab profile to www.byteblaze.com, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Check the API Documentation**: Verify if there is an API endpoint that allows updating user profile information.
2. **Use the API to Update the Profile**: If such an endpoint exists, use it to update the homepage URL.
3. **Verify the Update**: Check the profile page to ensure the homepage URL has been updated correctly.

### Step 1: Check the API Documentation

First, let's check if there is an API endpoint for updating user profile information.
CODE:
from utils import get_api_documentation_gitlab
get_api_documentation_gitlab('PUT /api/v4/users/{id}')

THOUGHT: ### Step 2: Use the API to Update the Profile

We have confirmed that the `PUT /api/v4/users/{id}` endpoint allows us to update user profile information, including the `website_url`. Now, let's use this endpoint to set the homepage URL on your GitLab profile to `www.byteblaze.com`.

We'll use the following parameters:
- `id`: 2330 (your user ID)
- `website_url`: `www.byteblaze.com`

Let's make the API call to update the profile.
CODE:
import requests

# Define the API endpoint and the access token
api_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/users/2330"
access_token = "glpat-KygcYjwtD2JfA6wU4wBd"

# Define the headers and payload
headers = {
    "PRIVATE-TOKEN": access_token,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
    "website_url": "www.byteblaze.com"
}

# Make the PUT request to update the profile
response = requests.put(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)

# Print the response
response.json()
