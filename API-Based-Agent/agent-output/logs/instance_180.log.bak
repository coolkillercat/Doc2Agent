Before actually using a Gitlab API call, you can should the `get_api_documentation_gitlab` function in the `utils` module to get detailed API documentation of the API. For example, if you want to use the API GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/repository/commits, you should first do: 
<execute_ipython>
from utils import get_api_documentation_gitlab
get_api_documentation_gitlab('GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/repository/commits')
</execute_ipython>
This will provide you with detailed descriptions of the input parameters and example output jsons.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 3:

THOUGHT: To check if your latest created issue with "dependency" in its title is closed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Fetch the list of issues created by you**: We will use the GitLab API to get the list of issues created by you.
2. **Filter issues with "dependency" in the title**: From the list of issues, filter out the ones that have "dependency" in their title.
3. **Sort by creation date**: Sort the filtered issues by creation date to get the latest one.
4. **Check the status of the latest issue**: Check if the latest issue is closed.

Let's start by fetching the list of issues created by you.

### Step 1: Fetch the list of issues created by you

We will use the API `GET /api/v4/issues` to fetch the list of issues. We will filter the issues by the author ID (your user ID: 2330).
CODE:
import requests

# Define the API endpoint and headers
api_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/issues"
headers = {
    "PRIVATE-TOKEN": "glpat-KygcYjwtD2JfA6wU4wBd"
}

# Define the parameters to filter issues by author ID
params = {
    "author_id": 2330,
    "per_page": 100  # Fetch up to 100 issues per page
}

# Make the API request to fetch the issues
response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers, params=params)
issues = response.json()

# Print the issues to inspect the response
issues

  'title': 'Add a treatment for consistent appearance of content on focus',
  'description': 'This issue arose from https://github.com/primer/react/pull/2593. \r\n\r\nThe SplitPageLayout component uses a small form with an input and submit button to allow for adjusting the pane width without the need for pointer input. This form is visually hidden, meaning that in its current implementation that only screen reader users will be aware of its presence. \r\n\r\nControls such as this [need to also be visually apparent on focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible.html). While only the SplitPageLayout component has this need right now, I anticipate other components needing similar functionality—and therefore a consistent visual treatment—as our Primer accessibility work continues.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no one set way to handle this kind of content. The closest examples I am aware of are our Skip to main content link and our dashboard favorites reordering functionality:\r\n\r\n<img width="455" alt="A blue rectangle containing the phrase, \'Skip to content\' appended to the top lefthand corner of the viewport on GitHub\'s homepage." src="/uploads/eb3e10ec15d4a1fe111513ead20b03d6/207390726-bcbdc0df-58a1-453b-8010-d073bb0f6434.png">\r\n\r\n![The favorite repo sidebar on GitHub\'s dashboard. A button containing an arrow with an upward-facing chevron and a focus ring is placed next to a favorited repo, indicating that it may be moved up in the list of favorite repos.](/uploads/09746c18d864d05ea517683d2b53f6e2/207390972-152567ca-8931-476f-823d-288aea5ef870.png)\r\n\r\nI am thinking that this is worth codifying as something that can be used as a subcomponent for other components, to help ensure a consistent, accessible experience that feels like it is a part of Primer. We\'ll likely want something along the lines of how [our Dialog component](https://primer.style/view-components/components/alpha/dialog) looks.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n- [Slack thread in #accessibility-internal](https://github.slack.com/archives/C01UWR2MEUB/p1670430365991479)\r\n- [Slack thread in #primer-design](https://github.slack.com/archives/CPA865D9S/p1670522653840849)\r\n- [AppFrame work](https://primer.style/css/storybook/?path=%2Fstory%2Fcomponents-layout-appframe--playground)',

Looking at our analytics, there (sadly) isn't a lot of activity with our [Contribute](https://www.a11yproject.com/contribute/) page.\r\n\r\nI'd like to remove Contribute from the primary navigation and replace it with the [Spotlight](https://www.a11yproject.com/spotlight/), as it has a decent amount of content now. It's my hope that we can keep pushing the Spotlight as a way to feature people doing good work in the digital accessibility space who typically aren't covered. \r\n\r\nI'm also advocating for the deletion of the Contribute page itself, since without it in the primary navigation it would push everyone towards our [Contributing Guidelines](https://www.a11yproject.com/contributing-guidelines/), which is the one-stop-shop for all the different ways someone can contribute. The original intent for the Contribute page was to be a way to quickly explain how to engage with the project, and then deep link to the relevant detail bits, but I think that the reality is the experience is now confusing on where to go (see https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/issues/1360).\r\n\r\nI'd also like to deprecate the [Changelog](https://www.a11yproject.com/announcements/#changelog), as the release notes are not automated, and they take a lot of time to make for something with not a lot of return. The original idea was we'd be highlighting external contributors more, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This includes what we're looking for, and what criteria may cause a rejection (reference [Social Media Posts](https://www.a11yproject.com/contributing-guidelines/#social-media-posts), [Promotions, partnership deals, and SEO scams](https://www.a11yproject.com/contributing-guidelines/#promotions-partnership-deals-and-seo-scams), [Plagiarism](https://www.a11yproject.com/contributing-guidelines/#plagiarism), and [Rejection](https://www.a11yproject.com/contributing-guidelines/#rejection) subsections).\r\n\r\nThese criteria have mostly been listed as a reaction to submitted content. We should consolidate and publicize our evaluation criteria to make it more understandable and equitable.

  'description': "Originating from a conversation with @mxmason.\r\n\r\nCurrently, our only language around how people who don't use Github can contribute is listed on our [Write for us](https://www.a11yproject.com/write-for-us/#if-you-do-not-have-a-github-account) page. There are two issues with this from my perspective:\r\n\r\n1. The content is not on our [Contributing Guidelines](https://www.a11yproject.com/contributing-guidelines/), or cross-linked there.\r\n1. The process is still too opaque to give a potential contributor an idea of what a non-Github content contribution process looks like.\r\n\r\nWe need to expand on this so it is more transparent and approachable. While we utilize Github as a method to run the site, it should not be a barrier for participation.\r\n\r\nIdeally, part of this involves people who have contributed without using Github who would be willing to identify areas of confusion or friction.",

  'description': 'Due to [the phenomenon of high volume, low quality PRs being generated from Hacktoberfest](https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/) in order to get free teeshirts, we will be marking all obvious attempts to game the system as spam and reporting them to [Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).\r\n\r\nAttempts include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Creating unnecessary or unwanted files, especially ones that don\'t map back to [an existing issue](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/issues).\r\n- Commits that add extraneous words in existing files, especially site documentation.\r\n- Files uploaded via GitHub with no context.\r\n- Minor cosmetic changes and self-described improvements to documentation that don\'t actually improve our content.\r\n- Localization attempts that fork the site and do not provide mechanisms for our team to ensure translated content is up to date.\r\n\r\nRejections are in-line with policies outlined in our existing [Contributing Guidelines](https://www.a11yproject.com/contributing-guidelines/#promotions-partnership-deals-and-seo-scams).\r\n\r\nWe hope that this does not affect new participants interested in making constructive contributions to our project. Issues labeled labeled as a ["Good First Issue"](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) are a great starting point for working with the project in a meaningful way. If you are looking for a good resource for contributing effectively to a project that participates in Hacktober, [Monica Powell has a great guide](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/set-yourself-up-for-success-open-source-contributions).\r\n\r\nTagging @digitalocean as a datapoint for future considerations on the impact of Hacktoberfest. It is our hope that they provide better mechanisms for future versions of the event as to not cause undue stress on Open Source maintainers.',

We can do better, however. We need:\r\n\r\n- [x] JavaScript validation logic for empty required input on form submission.\r\n- [x] Clear and concise error messaging associated with each input via ARIA.\r\n- [x] A summary area at the top of the form if more than one error is present, linking to each relevant input field.\r\n- [x] A designed error state that does not rely on color alone.\r\n',

We're proposing introducing a color theme switcher component to deal with their concerns.\r\n\r\n## Current issues\r\n\r\n- Some color combinations have been reported to be too harsh\r\n    - Notably, white on bright pink is causing Chromostereopsis-style effect\r\n- A dark mode can be helpful for things like low light/vision scenarios\r\n\r\n## Goals for the color theme switcher\r\n\r\n- [x] An accessible, semantic toggle for the control\r\n- [x] The current theme\r\n- [x] A muted theme\r\n- [x] A dark mode theme, triggered by `prefers-color-scheme: dark` but capable of being updated via the switcher\r\n- [x] Styling that integrates into our existing Sass setup, and not a filter overlay\r\n- [x] Localstorage to remember a user's preference\r\n\r\n## Relevant information\r\n\r\nMax Böck's implementation: \r\n- https://mxb.dev/blog/color-theme-switcher/\r\n- https://github.com/maxboeck/mxb/blob/master/src/includes/themepicker.njk\r\n\r\n**Additional examples shared via #939**\r\n\r\n- https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/create-a-user-controlled-dark-or-light-mode\r\n- https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/\r\n\r\nTagging @dennisgaebel, as they were involved in the discussions.",

  'title': 'Remove Gulp as a dependency',
  'description': "I love Gulp, but I love less external dependencies more. I initially used it for the redesign to get things up and running quickly.\r\n\r\nThe tasks we're using Gulp for are relatively straightforward, namely asset minification, concatenation, post-processing, and Browsersync. Because of this, there is an opportunity to do a lot of this via node scripts. Big-picture, I'd also like to lean more on Eleventy's capabilities to do the same—we're already using it for things like `addPassthroughCopy`.\r\n\r\nTo remove Gulp, we'd need to:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create node scripts for each Gulp task, and ensure feature parity.\r\n- [ ] See what tasks can be used in Eleventy directly.\r\n- [ ] Update `npm run a11yproject` to make sure it works.\r\n- [ ] Update Netlify to reflect these changes.\r\n- [ ] Remove references to Gulp in our documentation.\r\n- [ ] Do a little happy dance.",

We would want:\r\n\r\n- [ ] An accessible, semantic toggle for the control\r\n- [ ] Styling that integrates into our existing Sass setup, and not a filter overlay\r\n- [ ] Localstorage to remember a user's preference\r\n\r\nAndy Bell has [a good article on how to do this](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/create-a-user-controlled-dark-or-light-mode/), although we'd need to use ES5 and avoid using CSS custom properties for better legacy browser support. Additionally, [Smashing Magazine has another good post](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/) outlining some design considerations.",

This provides us with an excellent opportunity to tie the site's versioning to situations where the number can be used for things like cachebusting our CSS.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the site uses a manual `yyyymmdd` format to accomplish this. It would be great if we could expose the semver number as a variable and use that instead. This way, updating the site's version also automatically updates caching, etc.",

  'description': 'Right now it feels a little strange to be just dumped into the post categories with little explanation. What I\'d like to do is:\r\n\r\n- Explain what "a11y" means and point to [this article](https://a11yproject.com/posts/a11y-and-other-numeronyms/). I think it\'s important to stress how "a11y" speaks _specifically_ to web accessibility concerns.\r\n- Point to the checklist as a good place to get started if you don\'t know where to begin (and possibly revise checklist content, as well).\r\n- Surface other site content in the form of highlights. I\'m thinking things like the latest post, featured members of the a11y community, new resources and events, that sort of thing.\r\n',

THOUGHT: ### Step 2: Filter issues with "dependency" in the title

We will filter the issues to find those that have "dependency" in their title.

### Step 3: Sort by creation date

We will sort the filtered issues by their creation date to get the latest one.

### Step 4: Check the status of the latest issue

We will check if the latest issue is closed.

Let's proceed with filtering and sorting the issues.
CODE:
from datetime import datetime

# Filter issues with "dependency" in the title
dependency_issues = [issue for issue in issues if "dependency" in issue['title'].lower()]

# Sort the filtered issues by creation date in descending order
sorted_issues = sorted(dependency_issues, key=lambda x: datetime.strptime(x['created_at'], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'), reverse=True)

# Get the latest issue
latest_issue = sorted_issues[0] if sorted_issues else None

latest_issue

 'description': "I love Gulp, but I love less external dependencies more. I initially used it for the redesign to get things up and running quickly.\r\n\r\nThe tasks we're using Gulp for are relatively straightforward, namely asset minification, concatenation, post-processing, and Browsersync. Because of this, there is an opportunity to do a lot of this via node scripts. Big-picture, I'd also like to lean more on Eleventy's capabilities to do the same—we're already using it for things like `addPassthroughCopy`.\r\n\r\nTo remove Gulp, we'd need to:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create node scripts for each Gulp task, and ensure feature parity.\r\n- [ ] See what tasks can be used in Eleventy directly.\r\n- [ ] Update `npm run a11yproject` to make sure it works.\r\n- [ ] Update Netlify to reflect these changes.\r\n- [ ] Remove references to Gulp in our documentation.\r\n- [ ] Do a little happy dance.",

#  Remove Gulp as a dependency 

I love Gulp, but I love less external dependencies more. I initially used it for the redesign to get things up and running quickly. 

The tasks we're using Gulp for are relatively straightforward, namely asset minification, concatenation, post-processing, and Browsersync. Because of this, there is an opportunity to do a lot of this via node scripts. Big-picture, I'd also like to lean more on Eleventy's capabilities to do the same—we're already using it for things like ` addPassthroughCopy ` . 

To remove Gulp, we'd need to: 

  * Create node scripts for each Gulp task, and ensure feature parity. 
  * See what tasks can be used in Eleventy directly. 
  * Update ` npm run a11yproject ` to make sure it works. 
  * Update Netlify to reflect these changes. 
  * Remove references to Gulp in our documentation. 
  * Do a little happy dance.

Due to a dependency upon how eleventy processes incremental builds, we can get about 95% of the way towards this, but the build output will suffer due to eleventy's need to [ rebuild the entire site ](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/108) whenever a passthrough file copy operation occurs. Currently, this is on [ eleventy's Incremental enhancement board/roadmap ](https://github.com/orgs/11ty/projects/3) . 

After discussing with @ericwbailey, we decided to pause existing work on this PR until something moves on the parallelized/incremental build front with eleventy.
