### Retrieve All Submissions to a Forum

To retrieve all submissions to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`

#### Sort Submissions

You could sort the submissions by `hot`, `new`, `active`, `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`.

For `hot`, `new`, and `active`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/hot`.

For `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}?t={time}`. For $time, you could choose from `day` (which means the past 24 hours), `week` (which means the past 7 days), `month` (which means the past month), `year` (which means the past yeaer), and `all` (which means all times). For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=day` will get you the submissions in the past 24 hours, sorted by number of comments; `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=all` will get you all submissions until now, sorted by number of comments.

#### Retrieve a Specific Submission and All Comments to It

If you already has the submission_id that you would like to retrieve, then you are good to use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/{submission_id}`. For example, the submission_id for the submission with title 'New area code?' to the forum 'allentown' has the submission_id `123256`, then you could do `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

However, if you don't have the submission_id to the submission you would like to retrieve, but you have a keyword or the title of the submission and the name of the forum, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`, and then search for the keyword of the submission in the html response, and the locate the line with format `href="/f/{forum_name}/{submission_id}/...`. For example, if you would like to retrieve the submission to `allentown` with keyword `area`, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`, and then search for `area`. For instance, the response contains the following lines:

```html
<div class="submission__row">

      <div class="submission__inner">
        <header class="submission__header">
          <div class="submission__title-row break-text"><h1 class="submission__title unheaderize inline"><a href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"
         class="submission__link"
                  rel=""
          target="_self"
        >New area code?</a></h1>


                      </div>

          <p class="submission__info">
            <span class="text-sm fg-muted">
              Submitted by         <a href="/user/Francis-pencovic" class="submission__submitter fg-inherit"><strong>Francis-pencovic</strong></a>    <small class="fg-grey text-sm user-flag">t3_11xxi00</small>
   <time class="submission__timestamp"
        data-controller="relative-time"
        datetime="2023-03-21T22:40:42+00:00"
        title="March 21, 2023 at 10:40:42 PM UTC">on March 21, 2023 at 10:40 PM</time>
```
then, `123256` is the submission_id you want. You could find this submission_id by locating the line `href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"`. Then you could call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

### Retrieve All Comments to a Forum

Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To accomplish the task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the latest post from the "photoshopbattles" forum.
2. Identify the user who made this latest post.
3. Retrieve all comments made by this user.
4. Count the comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes.

Let's start by retrieving the latest post from the "photoshopbattles" forum.

### Step 1: Retrieve the latest post from the "photoshopbattles" forum
CODE:
import requests

# Define the base URL
base_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999"

# Retrieve the latest posts from the "photoshopbattles" forum
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/f/photoshopbattles/new")

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The HTML response is quite lengthy, but we need to extract the latest post and the user who made it. To do this, we will parse the HTML to find the relevant information.

### Step 2: Parse the HTML to find the latest post and the user who made it
CODE:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Parse the HTML response
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Find the latest post
latest_post = soup.find('article', class_='submission')

# Extract the user who made the latest post
user_link = latest_post.find('a', class_='submission__submitter')
latest_user = user_link.text.strip()

latest_user
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
'Proud_Idiot'

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have identified the user who made the latest post in the "photoshopbattles" forum: `Proud_Idiot`.

### Step 3: Retrieve all comments made by this user
CODE:
# Retrieve all comments made by the user
user_comments_response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/user/Proud_Idiot/comments")
