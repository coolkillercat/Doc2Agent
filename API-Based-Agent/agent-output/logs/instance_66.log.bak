### Retrieve All Submissions to a Forum

To retrieve all submissions to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`

#### Sort Submissions

You could sort the submissions by `hot`, `new`, `active`, `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`.

For `hot`, `new`, and `active`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/hot`.

For `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}?t={time}`. For $time, you could choose from `day` (which means the past 24 hours), `week` (which means the past 7 days), `month` (which means the past month), `year` (which means the past yeaer), and `all` (which means all times). For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=day` will get you the submissions in the past 24 hours, sorted by number of comments; `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=all` will get you all submissions until now, sorted by number of comments.

#### Retrieve a Specific Submission and All Comments to It

If you already has the submission_id that you would like to retrieve, then you are good to use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/{submission_id}`. For example, the submission_id for the submission with title 'New area code?' to the forum 'allentown' has the submission_id `123256`, then you could do `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

However, if you don't have the submission_id to the submission you would like to retrieve, but you have a keyword or the title of the submission and the name of the forum, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`, and then search for the keyword of the submission in the html response, and the locate the line with format `href="/f/{forum_name}/{submission_id}/...`. For example, if you would like to retrieve the submission to `allentown` with keyword `area`, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`, and then search for `area`. For instance, the response contains the following lines:

```html
<div class="submission__row">

      <div class="submission__inner">
        <header class="submission__header">
          <div class="submission__title-row break-text"><h1 class="submission__title unheaderize inline"><a href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"
         class="submission__link"
                  rel=""
          target="_self"
        >New area code?</a></h1>


                      </div>

          <p class="submission__info">
            <span class="text-sm fg-muted">
              Submitted by         <a href="/user/Francis-pencovic" class="submission__submitter fg-inherit"><strong>Francis-pencovic</strong></a>    <small class="fg-grey text-sm user-flag">t3_11xxi00</small>
   <time class="submission__timestamp"
        data-controller="relative-time"
        datetime="2023-03-21T22:40:42+00:00"
        title="March 21, 2023 at 10:40:42 PM UTC">on March 21, 2023 at 10:40 PM</time>
```
then, `123256` is the submission_id you want. You could find this submission_id by locating the line `href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"`. Then you could call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

### Retrieve All Comments to a Forum

To retrieve all comments to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/comments`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/comments`.

Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To accomplish the task of finding the URLs of posts that recommend a single book among the top 10 posts in the "books" forum, I will follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the top 10 posts in the "books" forum.
2. Analyze the content of each post to determine if it recommends a single book.
3. Extract and display the URLs of the posts that meet the criteria.

Let's start by retrieving the top 10 posts in the "books" forum.

### Step 1: Retrieve the top 10 posts in the "books" forum

I will use the API to get the top posts in the "books" forum.
CODE:
import requests

# Define the base URL
base_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999"

# Get the top posts in the "books" forum
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/f/books/top?t=all")
response.text

Saw it’s been a few months since this website was discussed. I actually just discovered it last night. Local bookstores are so important and they have so much character we should all do what we can to support this. 

This website allows you to select a local bookstore in your area and 30% of any book purchase on the website goes to the store. 

I think it is amazing!

I'm a manager at an indie bookstore and I agree, [ Bookshop.org ](https://Bookshop.org) is wonderful! It honestly helped keep a lot of smaller indies alive during the pandemic. 

I'd also encourage folks to checkout their local indie's website. It may promote things like free in-store events, indie-exclusive editions of new books, locally self-published authors, or signed bookplates. Plus a lot of them are unionized! 

Thank you so much for supporting independent bookstores and have a wonderful new year. 💕

I have purchased all my books through bookshop.org since the scummy treatment of their employees by Amazon started surfacing. It usually takes a couple of extra days for a book to arrive, but that has made them more of a 'surprise' in the mail. 

Also, if a book you want _isn't_ available on Bookshop, it's usually because the publisher is in an anti-competitive agreement with Amazon, and you should call/email/tweet/toot the _publisher_ (never the author) to complain.

Yes! 

This is particularly problematic with audiobooks. My partner reads them exclusively and even with the library, has not been able to successfully avoid Audible. A ton of audiobooks are exclusive.

Have you checked out [ Libro.fm ](https://Libro.fm) ? It's like Bookshop.org but for audiobooks! 

It doesn't answer the issue of some content being exclusive to Audible, but it's a nice alternative for traditionally published audiobooks.

My partner uses our library almost exclusively. He has only used Audible once, and it's because the book was an exclusive and he was super excited about it. Other exclusives he's run into, he ultimately doesn't read, which is disheartening. I don't think we've ever come across one he wanted that the library didn't have that wasn't an Audible exclusive.

I was on bookshop’s site the other day & it directed me to libro’s site for the purchase. If you didn’t know, libro isn’t much better to creators than amzn/audible & they also promote the monthly credit system.

Libro has been a wonderful partner for indie bookstores! 

I can only speak to my own experience with them as a bookseller and customer (I buy audiobooks every month from them without touching the credit system), and it's been nothing but positive. 

However, I cannot speak to the author's experience! Do you have a source you could point me to? I always want to learn more.

CORRECTION: per PeterAhlstrom “It’s significantly lower than 45% of retail when you use a credit” end correction 

As a customer of libro my only complaint is getting sucked into the monthly credits & then I learned from Brandon Sanderson’s team libro only gives authors 45%. 

Could you offer instruction how to link the comment here? I’m not sure how to do it. 

Edit: “Unfortunately, Libro.FM pays a very low royalty (based on the retail price) when you use a credit. That makes sense when you set the retail price high, but not when we set it at $15 because that's what people actually pay. So we (I'm Brandon's VP of publishing) had to pass on listing the books on Libro.FM. If they change their royalty for cheap books we'll happily change that.” From [ /u/peterahlstrom ](/user/peterahlstrom)

No. I'm not interested in putting narrators and authors out of business because I don't like Amazon. For many self-published authors, in particular, they're on Audible because they can't get on other platforms.

Most local bookstores will also order books for you and then they get 100% of the profit. But Bookshop.org is a great alternative if you don't actually visit your local bookstores often. Our closest bookstore just links to their bookshop.org page as their online store!

Indie bookseller here— some indie bookstores have online stores as well that you can order from. I do the online orders at the bookstore I work at and it’s always a thrill to get orders from people across the country who consider us their “local” indie!

My local bookstore has said that if it’s a book they don’t carry in-store, they make the same profit from bookshop.com as they do if you order from them directly. They heavily promote bookshop for that reason.

Most indies ship even if they don't have an online store. It means calling or emailing them instead of just clicking around but like if you ask directly then they also might tell you they have a used copy, or that the book releases in paperback soon or other useful things

Reminder: Libby is still OverDrive on the backend. Libby is just the new frontend user app to replace their previous app that was named OverDrive. It's all a part of their marketing to make it "friendly". 

It was: OverDrive the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

It's now: Libby the app to use OverDrive the service provided by OverDrive the company 

EDIT: I'm not saying it's bad at all! Sorry. I'm pointing it out because a lot of people think Libby is its own service and get confused about how it's a part of OverDrive.

Amazon owns them, but at least you are still buying from actual book shops, so they benefit.

I worked as the store manager of an indie shop for a few years after running their online store by myself. 

Abe hardly benefits the actual book shops. It's crowded with megasellers, just like Amazon is. I would say half of listings on both sites are by HalfPriceBooks or Goodwill. Most sellers who move over 1,000 books a year online will use an automatic listing service like Neatoscan that posts on Amazon and Abe (and like 10 other sites) at the same time. 

If you want to benefit actual book stores, buy from their website, call them and buy over the phone, or go visit them in person. Bookshop gets an honorable mention, because they share 30% of the profits with the book store while hosting the site and storing the books and doing the shipping. It's incredibly generous.

I use this site as much as possible instead of Amazon. The prices are not as low as Amazon (because, Amazon) but it's seriously just as convenient, and I love supporting local stores. I'll do this for gifts as well, when I send books to niblings for birthdays/Christmas. And you can preorder stuff too! I've ordered new stuff from Penguin Random House through Bookshop and it generally comes within a day or two of the release date.

Its really cool but I dont fancy paying delivery fees for already slightly more expensive books. I go to my local shops regularly but if I need something specific that they dont have - Blackwells. Free delivery on anything and 90% of the time prices are cheaper than anywhere else. And that’s why as much as I’d like, I won’t use bookshop.org 

Sadly, as of February, Blackwells is owned by Waterstones corporation. But they still have their own websites and prices and as far as I’m aware the employees are treated well. So I’d rather support them than something owned by Amazon.

But why not just order from your local bookstore's website? All Bookshop does is the same thing local bookstores do: buy the books from the publisher/distributor and then sell them to you. 

Why not give your local bookstore (or some bookstore of your choosing, if you don't have a "local") all the margin, rather than giving Bookshop a little cut? 

If for some reason I can't understand, it's Amazon or Bookshop, then by all means Bookshop. Amazon is bad. I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer, though I guess some locals just set Bookshop up as their online stores, in which case I guess Bookshop is just acting as a webhost and is charging the bookstore a fee for doing it, which is fine. 

Anyway, mostly just putting it out there that most local bookshops would be happy to ship books to you.

My local bookstore says that if it’s a book they don’t have in-store that youre picking up in-store, they make the same profit if you order from bookshop or from them directly. They promote bookshop a lot for this reason. You can always ask your local book store what works best for them.

> I just can't quite figure out what Bookshop offers that your local bookshop does not offer 

In short, Bookshop is a _tool_ that good local shops can use to boost their chances of making a sale. 

Bookshop is a great resource for indie stores that focus on promoting local authors and therefore have less in-store space for James Pattersons or Colleen Hoovers. If a fan of those books passes through town, however, the bookstore can still make the sale and gain a customer through bookshop. 

It's great for niche bookstores. I visited a small bookstore in Utah once that focused on mining history, Terry Tempest Williams desert ecology stuff, and touristy coffee table books of Utah scenery. If Bookshop had been a thing then, I could have asked for a copy of A Man Called ove, and they could have said "Sorry, we don't carry that one, since it's not Utah related, _but_ you can order a copy here," and hand me a card for bookshop. 

It's also a lifesaver for used bookstores. They tend to have little control over the books they have. Of course, they decide what to keep and what to put on the shelves, but they can't just magically make Brandon Sanderson books show up. At best, they can have some kind of request system that will flag books and send a notice to a customer. Being able to still sell a book without setting up the entire enterprise of a new bookstore is a saving grace.

As a bookseller, I make about the same profit margin, don’t have to place a special order or worry about shipping/damages from my publisher, and also bookshop provides a profit pool payout twice a year in addition to those funds.

I tried buying an ebook on Bookshop.org and the experience was awful. They required downloading a third-party app which was a hassle in itself. And the reading experience was horrible. It took 3-4 taps to open a book and there was no highlighting or note taking ability. I couldn’t find an option to download an epub to manually load onto my Kindle. Then I discovered their purchase agreement doesn’t allow returns on ebooks, even though this is not disclosed during checkout. Fortunately, they did give me a refund. 

Unfortunately, this is why I stick to Kindle. 

I’d love to find another option, but I also have similar trouble finding what I’m looking for on Libby. And when they do have it, I usually have to wait weeks to check it out.

Bookshop.org is fantastic however check who you're supporting by shopping there. The first few times I ordered my money was going to Reedpop, which isn't a giant Amazon conglomerate but not what I would call a small local business. Iirc you can specify through your order who you're supporting.

You can search by any zip code. So you can even help the store 30 min away!

With so many things going to ebooks, I fear for the future of used bookstores. 

That being said, I only have so many bookcases.

I almost never buy books, because I use minimalism to help manage my ADHD. (Thank you from my bottom to the libraries!) 

But I just read Emily Nagoski's Come As You Are. I was about to suggest it to my 18-year-old, when I realized that this is the kind of book that's more like a reference text that you might want to read slowly and revisit over the years. 

So I decided to buy her a copy. And I found my local bookseller on bookshop.org! I gave her the book yesterday, and it was predictably awkward, but I told her I wished I'd had that book when I was her age. I hope she finds it helpful.

If you have a website that offers affiliate links to vendors (like a blog), then Bookshop offers better terms on commissions than Amazon and you can feel good about where you’re sending folks. This is actually one of the major reasons it was created. 

And if you don’t have a store you’d like to support, you can shop without picking, and the store commission goes into a pool shared by all the independent bookstores who are registered with the site.

Isn't using a website like this avoiding that "character" the local bookstore has? 

If you're not going in, then why's it matter what that in-store experience is to you at that point? 

And further, why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? Why shouldn't a business halfway across the country deserve to survive just as much? I've never really understood this mentality that a business deserves to survive because it hasn't found much success and grown yet, but if it did grow then it'd no longer be worth spending money at

>why does a bookstore deserve money due to the arbitrary coincidence of its zip code matching your own? 

I think it's because indie bookstores usually offer something additional to their communities! 

For example, the indie I work for has the only free public restroom in the shopping area (we believe it's a human right), hosts free in-store events with authors, promotes locally self-published authors, drives authors to schools for in-classroom experiences for kids, hosts a holiday book drive to replenish our local school libraries, and sponsors events across the community! 

Yes, we sell books to the people in our community, but we also try to lift up our community. I hope that makes sense.

I like supporting my community because my community supports me. It’s not a matter of deserving it or not. I want to be able to walk to a bookstore owned by someone local, and purchase a book. I want my neighbors to be able to do the same. I want to be able to go to local book events and see local authors talk.

As a bookseller, my shop supports my community and a portion of profits go back into making our city a better place. I don’t “deserve money” from anyone but when people make the choice to support our shop it stays local, funds free programs, book giveaways and more, and helps our local economy. We work with local authors, nonprofits, and vendors as well giving them a platform.

Friendly reminder that Amazon has more small and local business on it, giving you a wider selection of independent booksellers to support at a lower cost to you and a higher profit to them as Amazon takes far less than 30% of sales.

Amazon has more sellers because it is the only* platform. 

Most of the book sellers are Half Price Books or Goodwill. 

As of 2021, Amazon charged a 15% fee AND a $1.85 fee for every book sale, left you to cover shipping, and you paid for your own warehouse. So on a $10.00 book, fees are already at 33.5% BEFORE shipping and handling.   
Oh wait, there's the cost of goods as well. It's not like you're getting books for free (unless you're Goodwill). Publishers usually charge stores about 40-60% of the cover price. 

So my ten dollar book gets me 6.65 before shipping and handling, 2.65 after shipping, 2.55 after storage if I have a great deal on a warehouse, and NEGATIVE $1.45 after I pay the publisher. 

A $30.00 book will only net me $7.52 after that. From that money, I need to pay employees and invest in improvements to my store.   
Bookshop just hands my store $9.00 on that same sale, and they store and they ship. 

*I know Amazon isn't the only platform, but they've dominated to market to the point of monopoly.

#  [ The simple greatness of Agatha Christie ](/f/books/59478/the-simple-greatness-of-agatha-christie)

Submitted by [ **-something_something** ](/user/-something_something) <::before><::after>t3_zvr666  2 years ago  in [ **books** ](/f/books)

Agatha Christie's novels feel so cozy, like hanging out with a friend while they solve a dilemma. I can rely on Christie to give me a mystery where all the pieces are there, you just have to pay enough attention to the details of people’s personalities to put them all together. She also writes entertaining characters to interact with her detectives. And she can still keep you guessing! The path to the inevitable conclusion is always just as fun and entertaining as finally getting to solve the mystery at the end. 

From a remote island to a snow-stalled train car, she favored locations isolated from society. By restricting the scope of her stories, Christie limited possible suspects and built tension by forcing characters to stay put— even with a killer among them. 

Sometimes she further heightened the drama by making the characters strangers, unsure of who they can trust. But while her settings are eerie and extraordinary, her characters are just the opposite. 

One of the biggest criticisms of Christie’s novels is that they’re full of two-dimensional people. But Christie avoided complex characters for a reason. By reducing people to a handful of simple traits, she provided readers with predictable suspects. Well, usually predictable. Christie also used the audience's expectations against them. 

However, this typecasting sometimes relied on what contemporary readers know to be harmful stereotypes. She frequently caricatured particular occupations and ethnic groups for comic effect, reinforcing the prejudices of her time. 

This is certainly not an element of Christie’s work worth emulating, and fortunately, many modern mystery writers have found less problematic ways to use this technique. Even when she got it wrong, Christie worked to make her characters feel authentic. 

She closely observed the people around her and constantly scribbled down details from overheard conversations. She would then rearrange these details to piece her mysteries together, often switching who the murderer was as she worked. This approach kept information murky and disoriented even to the sharpest readers. 

However, there’s an important balance to strike between being clever and being confusing. Nobody wants to read a predictable mystery, but if things get too convoluted you can lose your reader altogether. Christie handled this in part by keeping her language simple and accessible. She used short sentences and clear, snappy dialogue to help readers follow the information. This kind of clarity is essential because the best mysteries string their audience along with a carefully laid trail of clues. 

When a character cries that “Everything tastes foul today,” just minutes before he dies, the reader races to determine who poisoned his beverage. But they’re likely failing to truly consider this clue. If everything tasted foul that day, then he’d been poisoned long before that drink. 

Christie also used clues to intentionally mislead her audience. For example, readers might recognize a clue associated with one suspect, only to learn that it was being used to frame them. Other times, she built misdirection directly into the story’s structure— like when a narrator reporting the murder is revealed to be the killer. 

Outside crime and clues, there’s one more ingredient in Christie’s formula: the detective. Christie created many sleuths, but her most enduring are Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple. Neither this petit Belgian refugee nor this elderly amateur detective is a traditional hero. But their outsider status is exactly what helps them slip past security and make suspects let their guard down. 

With Christie, a good clue is one the reader will remember, but usually, fail to completely understand that is what I think made her one of the greatest.

A lot of Poirot are essentially puzzles, with the same pieces in different arrangements. The characters are all largely stock character 'types', but they're always enjoyable and it allows for misdirection because we expect certain types to behave in certain ways. 

Christie is also surprisingly funny. The Poirot novels that include Ariadne Oliver are good fun.

She is. The character is to make fun of herself, and address things people have said about her. 

And in Partners in Crime, Christie has Tommy and Tuppence reference/imitate different fictional detectives, including Poirot.

You might be interested in the genre “Cozy Mysteries”. It’s similar to Dame Christie’s. 

There’s a series by Zara Keane called “Movie Club Mysteries” that remind me of Agatha Christie’s style.

Great recommendation, definitely gonna look into those! (Also for future reference, when using someone's chivalric honorific, the custom is to use either their full name, or first name only.

I love Poirot novels, but one thing that gets predictable and frustrating after a few of them is that there is rarely an actual way for the reader to guess what happened.

I disagree. I think Christie is one mystery author who rarely cheats by withholding clues. It’s all there on the page. It may be subtle and require great deductions, but you can do it. I estimate my own success rate at around 50/50 or slightly higher. The ones I miss I can almost always remember back and kick myself for missing it. 

Arthur Conan Doyle, on the other hand, withheld information from basically all of his Sherlock Holmes stories. There’s a reason he titled so many of them “The Adventure of…” You’re supposed to marvel at Holmes, not solve a mystery.

It's been a while since I've read them, but Cards on the Table annoyed me the most with it as >!Poirot hires an actor at the end to bait the killer or something!<, but I feel like it happens in most Poirot novels. In Orient Express, for example, there is the part where it's noted that >!a bag wasn't actually covering a lock!<, which is fair enough, but it's hardly enough to deduce who the killer is.

I think Poirot's tricks to out the killer were usually moreso to get an admission of guilt in front of an audience than to actually figure out who done it

One good trick for Christies is that she loves to have simple motives at the end of the day; a husband wants his wife out his way so he can remarry, a simple trick to come into some money. Often a character will be suspicious since they obviously benefit from the crime, but due to the particular mechanics or circumstances it seems like it can’t be them. The core to the solution then ends up being the explanation of how it was physically possible for them to do it. 

Another good trick- >!never trust people who apparently hate each other! Christie loves to reveal that a pair of perfect enemies are in fact putting up a front, disguising the fact that they’re co-conspirators!<

While I also agree they are impossible to solve, Christie herself actually made sure in her books to provide the reader with all the clues the detective had. There is no hidden information. Can I make the same leaps as the detective does? God no. But all the puzzle pieces are given to you!

I agree. 

Unfortunately, after reading all books and watching all TV episodes, my memories are sparse. So, I'm not 100% sure if this happens on both book and TV or books are "fair". But I believe these are examples: 

>!Poirot had telegraphed her secretary trough her discovered that 2 people got married, only reveals it at the end.!<

>!Poirot knew the exact train timetable and was able to make deductions based on that.!<

>!In at least a couple of stories, events were related to an accident happened years before that was not fully presented. (Murder on the Orient Express)!<

>!In Curtains... well, you know what Poirot did.!<

Then, there are obstacles like very specific knowledge that a reader is unlikely to have. For instance, knowing how a poison works or the currency used in a foreign country. 

All in all, I believe Christie's stories are usually not solvable while reading the book. But they're always enjoyable. I like the richness in details and I find the characters more relatable. I have not enjoyed much Conan Doyle stories, to the point I feel the most famous detective should be Poirot instead of Sherlock Holmes. 

Apologies for my vague examples, I'm happy to edit and add references if someone can remember which book they happen on.

My only wish is that Hastings played more of a role in more stories. I suppose she limited his inclusion to dissuade readers from making more Sherlock Holmes comparisons. Her stories are all lovely. I recently read Dumb Witness, I really enjoyed it! Sometimes her most popular works like Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile can cast a shadow on the hidden gems.

I always felt like she felt like she had to give Poirot a Watson, but very quickly discovered she did not enjoy writing Hastings, who often comes across as "Watson, but dumb and with no helpful skills." 

Granted, I also think Curtain would not have been nearly as good without the foundation she DID lay with Hastings in earlier books.

Hers were the first books I picked for myself at the library when I was a new reader. I’ve adored her books for 40+ years now. During the pandemmy, when the world was going crazy and I felt like I’d lost control of everything, I turned to watching the Poirot and Marple TV shows as my “comfort viewing.” There was something so soothing about watching a show I’d seen 100 times and where I knew exactly what was going to happen, who was going to say what, etc. David Suchet got me through it! 

When people call her books “timeless” they aren’t exaggerating. The early Poirot books were set between WWI and WWII, then later post WWII and the Marple books were set in the 1950s but the stories could just as easily take place today. (I always wonder WTF was going on in Christie’s head where she came up with these plots. Amazing) 

I have all her books on my kindle and read when I need to take a break from reality. I also have her audiobooks narrated by Hugh Fraser and when I have trouble sleeping, I have him talk me to sleep. Works like a charm! 

Re-reading this, I think I’m seriously addicted to Agatha Christie stories.

Agatha Christie passed away almost 50 years ago but her detective works are still the best. I can't find anything as excellent as Christie's novels among modern authors. It's hard to count how many breakthrough elements she brought to the genre. Ordeal by Innocence, Five Little Pigs and Taken at the Flood are my favorite.

Watched that movie yesterday. Definitely very good. I'm liking that there's now an American entry to the canon of world-famous-detectives after Sherlock and Hercule (I'm sure there are other, American ones, but I haven't heard of them). 

Even though the actor himself isn't actually American. Still a very charming character.

Great review. Are you familiar with Dorothy Sayers? For mysteries from that era I like her better than Christie, although both are excellent. Just personal taste.

Thank you. 

And yes I have read Sayers she later turned in theological writing but I cannot say I have read all of them but she was probably the best-known and most beloved Golden Age author after Christie. While Agatha may have set the conventions for the plot, Sayers inspired dozens of fictional detectives with her creation, Lord Peter Wimsey. She is equally celebrated for Wimsey's love interest and eventual wife Harriet Vane, introduced in the dock for the murder of her lover in Strong Poison. 

The Nine Tailors is my favorite book of hers. Highly recommended.

They're an interesting study in contrasts despite being such close contemporaries. Sayers did complex characters and was far more interested in playing with the language of her writing. Christie was all about the plot. 

I love both.

"Agatha Christie's characters are stereotypes and caricatures, but they are not just that. They possess not simply two dimensions but two and a half. The little bit of fun gently poked at the "typical" figure, the slightly surprising or contradictory quality, the merest touch of real humanity—all make Christie's types just a bit more than cardboard puppets dancing to the choreography of the plot. In her characterization as in her puzzles, Christie found the perfect balance, the hallmark of the really skilled popular writer, between convention and invention. She gave her readers exactly what they anticipated, yet added just enough that was intriguingly new to keep them stimulated and absorbed." 

From here: [ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268163108.pdf ](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268163108.pdf)

Robert Barnard's book about Agatha Christie, _A Talent to Deceive_ , remains the best analysis of her. Tbh, the "average best" of Christie contains characterization depth that isn't much different from many modern crime writers.

Christie's mysteries are literally the "cozy mystery" category. And I love the light feeling she has in most of them. I also love how accurately she portrays characters. It was Christie who introduced me to sociopaths...those oh so charming, without morals killers of hers. (Though I was a lot older than 13 when I finally realized that's what she had done.) I don't think the term "sociopath" had even been invented when she portrayed one back in the 1920s. I love Christie's mysteries. I've read them all. Novels and short stories. The older I get, the more I appreciate Christie's insight into human nature. 

But when you say this... 

>I can rely on Christie to give me a mystery where all the pieces are there. 

No, you can't. 

You want that? Read the early Ellery Queen novels and short stories. The ones with the "challenge to the reader" where you have to turn the page to get to the solution.

OMG I went through a definite Christy stage when I was a tween. I still love the idea of them though I havent read any in decades. I think they ultimately fostered my imagination so much that I went on to become a ridiculously voracious reader. The first time I read 'And then there were None' aka 10 little indians I just couldnt believe how great a story it was - might have been 12yo. Then I learned that it was originally called 10 little (N words) and that was hugely disappointing. (I get that it was a product of the times etc, please dont come after me) I was also reading Victoria Holt and all the Poirots - and just started reading Sci-Fi! so I just moved on but I still (guiltily) love those Agatha Christy books that started it all. Miss Marple also rocks.

Anybody can chime in here. What are your favorite Christie novels? I loved her in middle/high school and now I’m in my early 30s I started grabbing the occasional Christie from the library and a few of them have fallen really flat. 

The ones I haven’t liked: Mysterious Affair at Styles, the Moving Finger 

Ones I think I remember liking: the Clocks, The ABC Murders, Murder on the Orient Express, and And then there were None.

Mysterious Affair at Styles is one of the weaker Poirots, IMHO (also the first, so, maybe fair), although having read it pays off a bit if you ever make it as far as Curtain, which is the last Poirot and I think hits differently if you've read most of the other Poirots before it, especially the ones that include Hastings. 

A few others I liked not on your list that I liked: Cards on the Table, Five Little Pigs, Death on the Nile. 

The only one of the Poirot books in my opinion that is really bad is The Big Four, and maybe even that is just because it wasn't what I wanted. It's... basically a James Bond novel, written a generation before there were James Bond novels, except instead of James Bond as the international super spy it's... Poirot for some reason.

Nice that’s good to hear. I read Styles after a hiatus of many years and felt pretty deflated about Christie, who I had previously enjoyed. Then I read the Moving Finger and it was a little better, still not very good, but it was my first Marple story and she was hardly in it at all!

Is Moving Finger the one where Miss Marple doesn't show up until like 70% of the way through the book? 

I don't mind Miss Marple as a character but sometimes it does feel like Christie has to contrive a bit to justify why she needs to / can solve a mystery. Poirot, at least, was this famous former professional police officer / detective.

I always return to Christie. My only gripe is that some of her books totally lack any denouement. Poirot presents his evidence, reveals the murderer and....THE END. 

She doesn't always do that, but it's disconcerting when she does. I want to atleast see the other characters' reactions to the news.

Agree with you fully! I love myself a Poirot story every few books. Books with Ariadne Oliver are the funniest. 

I would also recommend Sherlock Holmes, if you haven't read them already. Christie mentioned SH and Watson as her inspiration for Poirot and Hastings. 

The key difference is that Christie has murders invariably, whereas many SH stories have victimless crimes, even crimes that aren't clearly crimes by law. It makes it even more fun to solve such mysteries.

For those who might like an American twist, Charlotte Armstrong was a woman writer from the same period and her books, while suffering from the gender and race stereotypes of that time (I.e the writer and readers are all assumed to be White) are absorbing. Patricia Wentworth has a similar governess character Miss Silver who is called in with deep respect to solve mysteries. Dorothy Sayers has far more erudite mysteries, as does Georgette Heyer of Regency Romance fame.

I love Agatha Christie's novels. Each one is different, and I don't feel the reusing of a theme. Lovely books.

Thank you for you elegantly written review, You reminded me to pick on of her novels again. Few months ago I read _the ABC murders_ followed by _The murder of Roger Ackroyd_ ( the last made me want to throw the book off the window). Any suggestions of her least known works but as much enjoyable ?

I like your insight on Agatha Christie Books. I still vividly remember the first time when I read murder on the orient express. Because that feeling was something different back then. It was a really different style from other murder mystery books which I read then. And the fun part js I really enjoyed her style of writing. Tbh I only read a couple of her books which include Poirot so I still have a lot to read to understand her writing. 

Ps: Is there any chronological order to read Agatha Christie's books? Because Idk and I am reading in random order so.

I love that I’m not the only one that sees them as a comfort blanket. I’ve read them all at least once, have the audiobooks and adore the tv adaptations (suchet all the way) and I still enjoy them every time I start one. Honestly she was wonderful and also kinda bad ass making the whole country search for her when she disappeared.

Hey, there are many great recommendations in this thread you can pick anyone. As for close room mystery you can try 'they do it with mirrors', 'hercule Poirot's Christmas', 'the mysterious affair at styles', 'murder on the mews' and so forth. Happy reading.

> However, this typecasting sometimes relied on what contemporary readers know to be harmful stereotypes. She frequently caricatured particular occupations and ethnic groups for comic effect, reinforcing the prejudices of her time. 

I feel like, especially given that she was writing a century ago, Christie is relatively ahead of her time on this front. 

For example, it's not uncommon that there will be a non-protagonist character who is like "Well of course the Italian did it, they love stabbing people!" or whatever stereotype of the time but that person is pretty much always _wrong_ . It's pretty much never servants or random underclass people committing the murders either.

I'm having difficulty with all the "Vera said surprisingly: 'I'm surprised!" "John said in a hushed voice: 'Please be quiet y'all". It is like she wasn't sure if it was going to be a stage play or a novel. Though I'm aware it is both, it is making "And then there were none" somewhat difficult to enjoy.

#  [ I just finished reading The Hobbit to my 6 year old daughter, and she loved it! ](/f/books/17445/i-just-finished-reading-the-hobbit-to-my-6-year-old-daughter)

Submitted by [ **Shaosil** ](/user/Shaosil) <::before><::after>t3_ydeu5t  2 years ago  in [ **books** ](/f/books)

Some quick background - I've always been a Tolkien fan - read the main books, played the games, listened to the dramatizations and all that while I was growing up. Fast forward to now, Kiddos are around and my daughter absolutely loves to read. Proud parent sidenote, she's been reading by herself since 4, and is now at least at a 2nd grade level (she can read words like "enthusiastic" for example). 

Anyway, I was at Sam's Club the other day and decided to buy The Hobbit since I've never actually owned a copy. I suggested reading it to her and she seemed interested enough, though I did tell her it wasn't really a kids book per se and she's welcome to stop listening if she got tired of it. 2 weeks later and we finished all 300 pages, with her laughing at Bilbo's goofiness, quoting random pieces of it through the day, and talking about it sometimes when she gets home from school. For me, it was an adventure as well. I don't read nearly as much as I did when I was younger, so it was pretty refreshing. 

I did tell her about the Lord of the Rings book trilogy and mentioned how it might not be as interesting to her due to all the extra descriptions of armies, history, battle, and locations. But we'll see. 

Now we're starting to watch the Hobbit movies made a few years back. I realize they don't stand up to the books so much, but in my opinion (I've watched them before), they're accurate enough except for some unnecessary added details, and it's great to be able to put faces to the names right? 

I'm sure I'm not alone in introducing that level or style/world to kids that age, but it was a nice milestone moment for us. :)

The Hobbit is definitely a kid’s book. Tolkien wrote it to read to his kids at bedtime. Yeah they were a smidge older than 6 at the time, but not by much. Priscilla would have been 7 when it was published. He actually sent pre-published copies of the book out to children focus groups to get their feedback before he decided to publish it.

Good point! Sometimes I forget these type of books, with their expanded vocabulary and world building, can be targeted towards children. We have FAR too many "toddler" books in the house and this is so much different than those, haha

The Hobbit was the first non-picture book my dad got me. I was 7 and read the entire book at that age. I still have that old paper back copy. It has its wear and tear but its in decent enough shape for a paperback book that has been many times over the past 25 years. 

I think its awesome the OP read the book to their daughter. Ive always read ahead of my peers for my age as a kid, so I know I probably read it on my own earlier than normal, but regardless of how it's read it is such a delightful book for children IMO.

One thing I remember my father reading to me, as a bedtime story was Poe’s The Raven. I loved the story that makes up this poem. Another Poe poem he read to me now and then was his beautiful, haunting elegy for his Annabel Lee (sp? -1 word?), one of my favorite poems of Poe’s, apart from the great stories he wrote.

~~You should mark this with spoilers.~~

As for the death, A LOT of children's books, especially those written more than a few decades ago, have characters dying: 

>!Charlotte’s Web, Bambi, a Life in the Woods, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson series, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, The Giving Tree, Old Yeller, Bridge to Terabithia, Little Women, Esperanza Rising,...!<

And yeah, I bawled at some of them. Still remember.

The core story of the book developed from stories Tolkien told his children at bedtime. As he was writing it down he bean to include more and more references to his Middle-Earth works until finally the book was full-fledged Middle-Earth story.

Well, for a “children’s book”, The Hobbit is certainly, at least one of the best examples of a book written to, for or towards children; not unlike the beautiful language that Lewis Carroll (ne Charles L. Dodge, a mathematics “lecturer” at Christ Church, Oxford, London). His two “Alice” stories were written, also, in a way that never talked down to children.

My dad did the same thing when I was young. He would read a few pages each night before bed to me and my brother. Its one of my fondest memories of him and something i still remember now. Fast forward many years I'm now 30 and about 6 months pregnant and I already can't wait to be able to do the same when he gets old enough. I hope your daughter has as many fond memories of you reading it with her and I do with my dad!

Pick a couple of little books right now, and start reading them to your baby NOW! You'll be wonderfully awed by your child's attentiveness to those particular stories when they're born. 

My kids are 15 months apart. The oldest spent several months in the NICU and at some point I took in a cd player & at night I played the first Jewel album of lullabies, on repeat. I did that to create an ambient sound that we could take home because the only ambient sounds he would have heard are the monitors and machines and people. It was a lifesaver. Fast forward to my second child being born & that same music was equally effective for settling her at bedtime having "heard" it all through her gestation. Same for the books we read over and over. 

Reading to my kids is one of the things in motherhood that is purely good and joyful that I still love doing although they're 11 & 12 now so it's getting to be a thing I have to convince them is great!

Maybe one should play Wagner’s Der Ring der Nibelungen (Ring Cycle - a series of, like, 4-6 great operas, performed, one after the other, on my 13 CD copy, I have the whole Ring Cycle (Die Walkure, Lohengrin, Gotterdammerung and, about 3 others). That would be a good way to give your infant some culture, even though the baby doesn’t know WTF “culture” means (or how to say it)! But it could set the stage for a possible, if this went the way one hoped, appreciation for music.

As is well known, the Hobbit was written from the stories that Tolkien told to his kids. The pacing of the story reflects that. While each chapter contributes in some way to the overall narrative of getting to (or in, or out) of the lonely mountain, the book is constantly filled with little climaxes for each chapter as each substory (or night's reading) comes to an end. Think the encounter with the trolls, or when they're capture by goblins etc.

Not so graphic - naturally. I read it at about 12-13, read it to my boy at about 10. And yes, there's some difficult stuff in there. Just because it's a cartoon about rabbits doesn't make it easy - but hearing it read to you by a trusted adult over a good few nights is a lot easier. You can stop and discuss... And it's brilliant. A rabbit language, mythology/religion/folklore, political systems, enemies, predators, humour, love, care, bravery, sacrifice... Man. But she's six. So not yet.

The book is fantastic for children. As a kid I read it three times. There are some dark passages but nothing that is going to scar you. Duncton wood is another good book. That is centred on moles, not rabbits.

My dad read The Hobbit to me when I was 6. It is one of my core childhood memories. 

I later read the same tattered paperback copy many times growing up. 

As an adult, my girlfriend (now wife), brought that tattered paperback to a book restorer and had it restored and bound. It is one of my most cherished possessions. 

I am anxiously awaiting the time I get to read it to my son.

I read this book to our kids during a cross country road trip. I tried to do different voices for all the characters as well as singing the songs. 

I got in over my head pretty quickly when the number of characters far outpaced the number of voices I could do. And we would get back into the car after a break, and my kids would be all like, “that that’s not the right voice for him.”

I love the writing style of The Hobbit and its humor makes me actually laugh out loud. One of the only books that does that for me. I loved the movies too, despite how bloated they are. There are a few scenes that I loved seeing in film, including the barrel ride down the river (even though a lot of extras were added there), and really any scene with Smaug. Benedict Cumberbatch was perfect as Smaug's voice as well.

I have recently learned that audio books are very helpful for people like me. My brain processes lecture material better than written content. Science backs this as well 

My dad was in the military when I was a kid in Naples Italy. I would listen to the armed forces radio network at night before bed. I let my imagination run wild as I listened to the actors using props to make various sounds. It was magical to me. 

The Hobbit books opened my eyes to the mystical world Tolkien painted. It was wonderful as well. Reading retention with fiction was less of a problem. 

Today I read to my grand kids every chance I have. 

Helping kids and some adults like me read books at public libraries has been a joy

Not Hobbit related, but kid and book related: make sure you check out Project Gutenberg and Librevox. A lot of content. Sure, some browsing/wading but there are gems. 

We had Thornton Burgess (Mother West Wind's Children) when I was about the age as yours. Later with my own young kids I used Burgess audio tapes for a long car journey and I think that was from Librevox. 

The Hobbit was one of the first big books I read on my own as a kid though.

Joining the "book was better" club at the tender age of six hahaha. 

This is great. I hope this will be my experience with my son too. He's still just a baby but we read his board books every day and he really loves it so far so I'm hopeful.

I read The Hobbit to my son and daughter at 6. It was outstanding. My son is almost 8 now and Sam just glimpsed Mount Doom for the first time tonight. It has been a slow but very fun read. Don't be afraid to read above their age level, defining words as you go and helping with comprehension. 

Someone in the thread said this was a core memory for them as a kid. This is a core memory for me as an adult.

My husband read the Hobbit to all of our kids, and LOTR to the older ones (now 11 and 9; our youngest is 6). It's been their "thing" and they loved it. He watched the movies with our oldest as they finished the books. 

My own ritual with them has been reading the Harry Potter books; we've been discussing starting with the youngest soon.

My son and I are nearly through it. We were so glad the barrel ride was only a few pages and not spread across several months as the film seems to be. 

Also, I've had great fun reading Gandalf in a really thick North Yorkshire accent. "I can't believe yer left Bilboo wi' goblins". Difficult to put on a page, that.

I am reading through this to my 7yo. She is loving it, and after the slow opening she is totally engaged with the narrative and fun characters. Chapter 5, I think (the cave and ring) was a huge stand out. I have been waiting years to read this with her and have been loving it. 

Oh side note. I have two copies of the text, a large copy with illustrations and old basic text one. She loves to read the small, old text along with me and she will read lines, songs or other parts as I read the main narrative. She is a very strong reader and has loved being part of the storytelling.

My dad read my brother and I _The Hobbit_ on a camping trip. 

The flickering light of the campfire set the mood perfectly. He had fun doing the different voices, giving homage to the lyrical whimsy in the prose, when it surfaced. 

My mom gave us mugs of hot apple cider as we listened to this charming adventure, one dotted with terrors made all the more real by the surrounding dark, and the night sounds of nature. 

It become a thing; each trip he'd read another part until we got through _The Lord of the Rings_ . 

A lovely memory that my brother and I will always treasure.

Then we saw the 1977 broadcast of [ The Hobbit movie ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5fwixXmUlE) , which although it was a children's movie, it was amazingly faithful to the book.

My dad read me this before I could read myself. I learned to read because I wanted to read the Hobbit. 

Also, we started LoTR but quit at Weathertop because I was too scared of the black riders at age 4-5 lol. 

But I am so happy she loves it! Chronicles of Narnia are good ones for that age too and maybe she could even get to Harry Potter soon. 

Some of the best memories I share with my dad are his sharing his love of Tolkien and CS Lewis with me as a child. :)

I read The Hobbit to my older kids right before the movie came out. I think they were about 8 and 6. I took them to the movie without even really checking the rating. We all felt the movie was much more violent and intense than what we pictured when reading! I had a more animated version in my head. That's Hollywood I guess.

I was incredibly fortunate that my first exposure to fantasy was The Hobbit, read aloud by a rather large fellow who would come to our classroom, sit on the floor in a beanbag chair he brought with him, and read to us for an hour a few times a week.

I think I was about six when my dad checked out an illustrated copy of the Hobbit from the library. It had still images from the Rankin Bass 70s cartoon. That version is out of print now so it's difficult and expensive to come by, but I'm hoping to find another illustrated version to read to my kid soon as she is almost six herself. I think that book is a big part of why I still love reading fantasy, it's just such a wonderful story.

That's amazing she has the attention to lock in for so long. I can't even finish reading a thin traditional kids book before my daughter is over it and tells me to read a different one, now this one, ok this one. And she's 5. I think she has ADD or just likes bossing me tf around.

I am reading this to my 6 year old too! I have notes throughout the book to remind what voice each character is. My daughter loves it that I have a voice for everyone and it’s made reading this such a challenge but motivating to continue bc she loves my impressions.

I was a seven year old ESL kid when I read The Hobbit for the first time. It's still one of my favourites - I worked out the runic alphabet from the map at the beginning of the book and every few years or so, start transcribing the Hobbit in Dwarf runes for fun. 

So lovely to hear your daughter loves it as part of the next generation!

My brother began reading the Harry Potter books to his daughter when she was 5yo and continued as they were published. 

She was a December baby, so had to go to Transitional Kindergarden. Midway, she taught herself to read by Kindergarden and just kept going. 

Brother discovered her reading ahead of him much to his afmuration and chagrin. Lol.

The Hobbit is a great parents/kids book ( shame they didn’t do that with the films). You might want to see if she is ready for the wonderful Northern Lights next. And something to perhaps work towards is the Skullduggery Pleasant series - great books and great female lead character if that is of interest. Also see the Song of the Lioness/Protector of the Small author Tamora Pierce.

The Hobbit is great for kids but LOTR really isn't . I know someone abridged it unofficially for a younger audience ,which cut out a lot of the fat and made it slightly more Hobbit like apparently

Please, the [ Rankin/Bass Hobbit movie ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077687/) is superior. It's even a cartoon, so it may appeal to your child more.

You know, The Hobbit films are no Lord of the Rings, but they are good popcorn flicks, and what the films get right (Bilbo, Smaug, Gollum, some of the setpiece scenes like the dwarven singing and Beorn) they get very right. If those films pass your violence check for your daughter (I mean, at 6 I watched and loved _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ ), they'd be fine to watch.

My 6 year old loves LOTR too! Granted we've only watched the movies together. The Hobbit is one of my favorite books of all time though and I'm hoping once he starts reading proficiently he'll want to read it. I bought a cute illustrated version just for that purpose, it's sitting in a special spot and whenever he's ready I hope he'll pick it up.

I was 8 years old when my grade 3 teacher recommended The Hobbit to me and even lent me a copy to read. I had been a voracious reader since before school and she was like “you’ll like this book - trust me.” 

She wasn’t wrong. It’s a great book for all ages.

Submitted by [ **ancienthippo** ](/user/ancienthippo) <::before><::after>t3_zs60at  2 years ago  in [ **books** ](/f/books)

I’m familiar with the story and have watched a couple different adaptations throughout my life, but this is my first time reading the book. I decided to read the book while also listening to the audiobook and found out that LeVar Burton narrates a free version on Apple Books!! He brought so much life to the story and I absolutely loved it!

They also have The Time Machine read by Kelsey Grammer - not sure if this link will work, but it’s worth a shot: [ https://books.apple.com/gb/audiobook/the-time-machine/id1445220934 ](https://books.apple.com/gb/audiobook/the-time-machine/id1445220934)

Reading the book while listening to the book sounds amazing for my ADHD. Bering able to assign voice inflections to people would help with my memory so much. 

I love books but unless my brain wants to read a bit after I’ve taken my meds I’ll usually just watch a movie or play video games. I think this may be a great thing to get me engaged in books again

I own a facsimile of the original print from the 1800s. It’s fantastic. 

Btw, if you didn’t know, the reason the ghost of Christmas present only has that many siblings is because that’s how many years it has been since Christ’s birth

I’ve got to be honest. I read the title with the author as being “Lamar Ball”… and I wasn’t sure if I could live in a world where that was the case.
