Below is the list of all APIs you can use for reddit and their descriptions:
## Forums

### List All Forums

To retrieve the names of all the forums, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/forums/all`.

#### Response

The response contains HTML contents including the names of all the forums sorted by alphabetical order. For example,
```html
<li><a href="/f/allentown">allentown</a></li>
```
this means a forum named `allentown`, and to retrieve the contents in this forum, you would need to do `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`.


### **Get Forum by ID**

#### **Response**:
- Returns a JSON object containing the result of the subscription.

---

#### Unsubscribe from a Forum
To unsubscribe from a forum, use the predefined `utils` function `unsubscribe_forum`.  
To use this function, run:

```python
from utils import unsubscribe_forum
```

#### **Input Parameters**:
- **forum_name** (str): The name of the forum you want to unsubscribe from. Example: `'relationship_advice'`.

#### **Response**:
- Returns a JSON object containing the result of the unsubscription.

### Retrieve All Submissions to a Forum

To retrieve all submissions to a forum, you could use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`

#### Sort Submissions

You could sort the submissions by `hot`, `new`, `active`, `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`.

For `hot`, `new`, and `active`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}`. For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/hot`.

For `top`, `controversial`, and `most_commented`, you could sort by these attributes using the API format `http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}/{attribute}?t={time}`. For $time, you could choose from `day` (which means the past 24 hours), `week` (which means the past 7 days), `month` (which means the past month), `year` (which means the past yeaer), and `all` (which means all times). For example, `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=day` will get you the submissions in the past 24 hours, sorted by number of comments; `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown/most_commented?t=all` will get you all submissions until now, sorted by number of comments.

#### Retrieve a Specific Submission and All Comments to It

If you already has the submission_id that you would like to retrieve, then you are good to use the API `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/{submission_id}`. For example, the submission_id for the submission with title 'New area code?' to the forum 'allentown' has the submission_id `123256`, then you could do `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/123256` to retrieve the submission and all comments to this submission.

However, if you don't have the submission_id to the submission you would like to retrieve, but you have a keyword or the title of the submission and the name of the forum, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/{forum_name}`, and then search for the keyword of the submission in the html response, and the locate the line with format `href="/f/{forum_name}/{submission_id}/...`. For example, if you would like to retrieve the submission to `allentown` with keyword `area`, then you could first call `get http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/allentown`, and then search for `area`. For instance, the response contains the following lines:

```html
<div class="submission__row">

      <div class="submission__inner">
        <header class="submission__header">
          <div class="submission__title-row break-text"><h1 class="submission__title unheaderize inline"><a href="/f/allentown/123256/new-area-code"
         class="submission__link"
                  rel=""
          target="_self"
        >New area code?</a></h1>


                      </div>

          <p class="submission__info">
            <span class="text-sm fg-muted">
              Submitted by         <a href="/user/Francis-pencovic" class="submission__submitter fg-inherit"><strong>Francis-pencovic</strong></a>    <small class="fg-grey text-sm user-flag">t3_11xxi00</small>
   <time class="submission__timestamp"
        data-controller="relative-time"
        datetime="2023-03-21T22:40:42+00:00"
        title="March 21, 2023 at 10:40:42 PM UTC">on March 21, 2023 at 10:40 PM</time>

Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To complete the task, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve the 5 most recent posts from the "space" forum on Reddit.**
2. **Create a folder named `real_space` in the `gimmiethat.space` repository on GitLab.**
3. **Create a file named `urls.txt` within the `real_space` folder and add the URLs of the 5 most recent posts.**

Let's start with step 1: Retrieve the 5 most recent posts from the "space" forum on Reddit.

### Step 1: Retrieve the 5 Most Recent Posts from the "space" Forum on Reddit

We will use the Reddit API to get the most recent posts from the "space" forum.
CODE:
import requests

# Define the base URL for Reddit
reddit_base_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999"

# Get the 5 most recent posts from the "space" forum
response = requests.get(f"{reddit_base_url}/f/space/new")
response.raise_for_status()

# Parse the response to extract the URLs of the 5 most recent posts
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
posts = soup.find_all('a', class_='submission__link', limit=5)
post_urls = [reddit_base_url + post['href'] for post in posts]

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The URLs retrieved from the Reddit API contain an incorrect base URL prefix. We need to correct these URLs before proceeding to the next steps.

### Step 2: Correct the URLs

Let's correct the URLs by removing the incorrect base URL prefix.
CODE:
# Correct the URLs by removing the incorrect base URL prefix
corrected_post_urls = [url.replace("http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999", "") for url in post_urls]
corrected_post_urls
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: ### Step 3: Create a Folder and File in the GitLab Repository

Now that we have the corrected URLs, we need to:
1. Create a folder named `real_space` in the `gimmiethat.space` repository.
2. Create a file named `urls.txt` within the `real_space` folder and add the URLs of the 5 most recent posts.

Let's start by creating the folder and file in the GitLab repository using the GitLab API.

#### Create the `real_space` Folder
CODE:
# Define the GitLab base URL and access token
gitlab_base_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023"
access_token = "glpat-KygcYjwtD2JfA6wU4wBd"
project_id = "gimmiethat.space"

# Create the real_space folder
create_folder_url = f"{gitlab_base_url}/api/v4/projects/{project_id}/repository/files/real_space%2FREADME.md"
headers = {
    "PRIVATE-TOKEN": access_token
}
data = {
    "branch": "main",
    "content": "This is the real_space folder.",
    "commit_message": "Create real_space folder"
}

response = requests.post(create_folder_url, headers=headers, data=data)
response.raise_for_status()
response.json()
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTPError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[1], line 18
     11 data = {
     12     "branch": "main",
     13     "content": "This is the real_space folder.",
     14     "commit_message": "Create real_space folder"
     15 }
     17 response = requests.post(create_folder_url, headers=headers, data=data)
---> 18 response.raise_for_status()
     19 response.json()

File ~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/requests/models.py:1024, in Response.raise_for_status(self)
   1019     http_error_msg = (
   1020         f"{self.status_code} Server Error: {reason} for url: {self.url}"
   1021     )
   1023 if http_error_msg:
-> 1024     raise HTTPError(http_error_msg, response=self)

HTTPError: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4/projects/gimmiethat.space/repository/files/real_space%2FREADME.md

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The error indicates that the URL for creating the folder is incorrect. The project ID should be a numeric ID rather than the project name. Let's first retrieve the project ID for the `gimmiethat.space` repository.

### Step 3.1: Retrieve the Project ID for `gimmiethat.space`
CODE:
# Get the list of projects to find the project ID for gimmiethat.space
projects_url = f"{gitlab_base_url}/api/v4/projects"
response = requests.get(projects_url, headers=headers)
response.raise_for_status()

# Find the project ID for gimmiethat.space
projects = response.json()
project_id = next((project['id'] for project in projects if project['name'] == 'gimmiethat.space'), None)
project_id
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
[Code executed successfully with no output]

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the project ID retrieval did not produce any output. Let's try to list all projects again and identify the correct project ID for `gimmiethat.space`.

### Step 3.1: List All Projects to Identify the Project ID for `gimmiethat.space`
CODE:
# List all projects to find the project ID for gimmiethat.space
response = requests.get(projects_url, headers=headers)
response.raise_for_status()

# Display the list of projects
projects = response.json()
projects

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The project `gimmiethat.space` is not listed in the retrieved projects. This might be due to pagination or other issues. Let's try to list more projects to ensure we capture all available projects.

### Step 3.1: List More Projects to Identify the Project ID for `gimmiethat.space`
CODE:
# List more projects to find the project ID for gimmiethat.space
response = requests.get(projects_url, headers=headers, params={"per_page": 100})
response.raise_for_status()

# Display the list of projects
projects = response.json()
projects
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
