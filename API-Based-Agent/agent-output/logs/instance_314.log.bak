Note: Before actually using a Gitlab API call, *you should call the `get_api_documentation_gitlab` function in the `utils` module to get detailed API documentation of the API.* For example, if you want to use the API GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/repository/commits, you should first do: 
<execute_ipython>
from utils import get_api_documentation_gitlab
get_api_documentation_gitlab('GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/repository/commits')
</execute_ipython>
This will provide you with detailed descriptions of the input parameters and example output jsons.IMPORTANT: You should ONLY interact with the environment provided to you AND NEVER ASK FOR HUMAN HELP.
When you think you have completed the request, please run the following command: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.

Step 3:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To list the top 3 contributors to the `primer/design` repository ranked by the number of commits, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Project ID**: We need to get the project ID for the `primer/design` repository.
2. **Fetch Contributors**: Use the API to fetch the list of contributors for the identified project.
3. **Sort and Select Top 3**: Sort the contributors by the number of commits and select the top 3.

Let's start by identifying the project ID for the `primer/design` repository.

### Step 1: Identify the Project ID

We will use the `GET /api/v4/projects` API to list all projects and find the ID for the `primer/design` repository.
CODE:
import requests

# Define the base URL and headers
base_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4"
headers = {
    "PRIVATE-TOKEN": "glpat-KygcYjwtD2JfA6wU4wBd"
}

# Fetch the list of projects
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/projects", headers=headers)
projects = response.json()

# Find the project ID for 'primer/design'
project_id = None
for project in projects:
    if project['path_with_namespace'] == 'primer/design':
        project_id = project['id']
        break

project_id
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
[Code executed successfully with no output]

Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was no output from the previous code execution. This might be due to the response not containing the expected data or an issue with the request. Let's try fetching the project ID again, but this time we'll ensure we handle pagination and print the response to verify the data.

### Step 1: Identify the Project ID (Retry with Pagination and Print Response)

We'll fetch the list of projects and print the response to verify the data.
CODE:
import requests

# Define the base URL and headers
base_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4"
headers = {
    "PRIVATE-TOKEN": "glpat-KygcYjwtD2JfA6wU4wBd"
}

# Fetch the list of projects with pagination
page = 1
projects = []
while True:
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/projects", headers=headers, params={"page": page, "per_page": 100})
    data = response.json()
    if not data:
        break
    projects.extend(data)
    page += 1

# Print the projects to verify the data
projects
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have successfully retrieved the list of projects. Now, let's identify the project ID for the `primer/design` repository.

From the observation, we can see that the project `primer/design` is listed. Let's extract its project ID.

### Step 2: Fetch Contributors

Now that we have the project ID, we can fetch the list of contributors for the identified project using the `GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/repository/contributors` API.
CODE:
# Extract the project ID for 'primer/design'
project_id = None
for project in projects:
    if project['path_with_namespace'] == 'primer/design':
        project_id = project['id']
        break

# Fetch the list of contributors for the identified project
if project_id:
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/projects/{project_id}/repository/contributors", headers=headers)
    contributors = response.json()
    contributors
else:
    "Project ID for 'primer/design' not found."
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
[Code executed successfully with no output]

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was no output from the previous code execution. This might be due to the response not containing the expected data or an issue with the request. Let's try fetching the project ID again, but this time we'll ensure we handle pagination and print the response to verify the data.

### Step 1: Identify the Project ID (Retry with Pagination and Print Response)

We'll fetch the list of projects and print the response to verify the data.
CODE:
import requests

# Define the base URL and headers
base_url = "http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/api/v4"
headers = {
    "PRIVATE-TOKEN": "glpat-KygcYjwtD2JfA6wU4wBd"
}

# Fetch the list of projects with pagination
page = 1
projects = []
while True:
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/projects", headers=headers, params={"page": page, "per_page": 100})
    data = response.json()
    if not data:
        break
    projects.extend(data)
    page += 1

# Print the projects to verify the data
projects
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: We have successfully retrieved the list of projects and identified the project ID for the `primer/design` repository. The project ID is `210`.

### Step 2: Fetch Contributors

Now that we have the project ID, we can fetch the list of contributors for the identified project using the `GET /api/v4/projects/{id}/repository/contributors` API.
CODE:
# Define the project ID for 'primer/design'
project_id = 210

# Fetch the list of contributors for the identified project
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/projects/{project_id}/repository/contributors", headers=headers)
contributors = response.json()
contributors
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
[{'name': 'GitLab',
  'email': 'root@localhost',
  'commits': 1,
  'additions': 0,
  'deletions': 0}]

Step 8:
act - **BrowseInteractiveAction**
BROWSER_ACTIONS: goto("http://ec2-18-219-239-190.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/primer/design/-/graphs/master")

#  <::after> Introduction 

This is a template for doing Android development using GitLab and [ fastlane ](https://fastlane.tools/) . It is based on the tutorial for Android apps in general that can be found [ here ](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/) . If you're learning Android at the same time, you can also follow along that tutorial and learn how to do everything all at once. 

#  <::after> Reference links 

  * <::marker> [ GitLab CI Documentation ](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
  * <::marker> [ Blog post: Android publishing with GitLab and fastlane ](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/28/android-publishing-with-gitlab-and-fastlane/)



You'll definitely want to read through the blog post since that walks you in detail through a working production configuration using this model. 

#  <::after> Getting started 

First thing is to follow the [ Android tutorial ](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/) and get Android Studio installed on your machine, so you can do development using the Android IDE. Other IDE options are possible, but not directly described or supported here. If you're using your own IDE, it should be fairly straightforward to convert these instructions to use with your preferred toolchain. 

##  <::after> What's contained in this project 

###  <::after> Android code 

The state of this project is as if you followed the first few steps in the linked [ Android tutorial ](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/) and have created your project. You're definitely going to want to open up the project and change the settings to match what you plan to build. In particular, you're at least going to want to change the following: 

  * <::marker>Application Name: "My First App" 
  * <::marker>Company Domain: "example.com" 



###  <::after> Fastlane files 

It also has fastlane setup per our [ blog post ](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/28/android-publishing-with-gitlab-and-fastlane/) on getting GitLab CI set up with fastlane. Note that you may want to update your fastlane bundle to the latest version; if a newer version is available, the pipeline job output will tell you. 

###  <::after> Dockerfile build environment 

In the root there is a Dockerfile which defines a build environment which will be used to ensure consistent and reliable builds of your Android application using the correct Android SDK and other details you expect. Feel free to add any build-time tools or whatever else you need here. 

We generate this environment as needed because installing the Android SDK for every pipeline run would be very slow. 

###  <::after> Gradle configuration 

The gradle configuration is exactly as output by Android Studio except for the version name being updated to 

Instead of: 

` versionName "1.0" `

It is now set to: 

` versionName "1.0-${System.env.VERSION_SHA}" `

You'll want to update this for whatever versioning scheme you prefer. 

###  <::after> Build configuration ( ` .gitlab-ci.yml ` ) 

The sample project also contains a basic ` .gitlab-ci.yml ` which will successfully build the Android application. 

Note that for publishing to the test channels or production, you'll need to set up your secret API key. The stub code is here for that, but please see our [ blog post ](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/28/android-publishing-with-gitlab-and-fastlane/) for details on how to set this up completely. In the meantime, publishing steps will fail. 

The build script also handles automatic versioning by relying on the CI pipeline ID to generate a unique, ever increasing number. If you have a different versioning scheme you may want to change this. 
    
    
        - "export VERSION_CODE=$(($CI_PIPELINE_IID)) && echo $VERSION_CODE"
        - "export VERSION_SHA=`echo ${CI_COMMIT_SHA:0:8}` && echo $VERSION_SHA"
