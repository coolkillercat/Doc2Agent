    """
    Compares code between two branches, tags, or commits in a GitLab repository, showing the differences between them.
    Useful for code reviews, tracking changes across branches, or identifying specific commits that introduced changes.
    
    Args:
        project_id (str): The ID or URL-encoded path of the project
        from_ref (str): The commit SHA or branch name to compare from
        to_ref (str): The commit SHA or branch name to compare to
        from_project_id (int, optional): The ID to compare from. Defaults to None.
        straight (bool, optional): Comparison method: True for direct comparison, False to compare using merge base. Defaults to False.
        unidiff (bool, optional): Present diffs in the unified diff format. Defaults to False.
    
    Returns:
        dict: Response containing comparison details including commits and diffs
        
    Example:
        >>> compare_repository_code(project_id="183", from_ref="main", to_ref="master")
        # Returns comparison between main and master branches
        
        >>> compare_repository_code(project_id="183", from_ref="v1.0", to_ref="v2.0", straight=True)
        # Returns direct comparison between v1.0 and v2.0 tags
